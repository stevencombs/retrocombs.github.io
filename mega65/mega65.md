Followers of my blog and YouTube channel know I own a MEGA65 DevKit and have been closely following the development of the MEGA65 as shown in animation below.

I use my DevKit not in the true developer sense, but rather to help spread the word of why every Commodore retro-computing fan needs to start saving their pennies and of course selfishly, to have a great time learning about this computer that "could have been."

## Key to Keys

Because the MEGA65 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I use a modified "key to keys" nomenclature I developed for my [Commodore Plus/4 series](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4) to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key     | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:--------|:--------------|:-----|:------------|
| `⇪`     | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `[C=]`  | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `⌃`     | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `⎋`     | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `⌂`     | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `⌫`     | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `⏎`     | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `⇧`     | Shift         | `␣`  | Space       |
| `↑`     | Cursor Up     | `↓`  | Cursor Down |
| `→`     | Cursor Right  | `←`  | Cursor Left |
