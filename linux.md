While I'm an [Apple fan](/apple.html), I also believe Linux to be a viable alternative for both new and old computers. It also is the OS behind many of my [physical computing projects](http://www.stevencombs.com/embedded.html). As you will find below, I tend to try multiple distributions (versions) of Linux and have yet to settle on a single one. Thatâ€™s part of the fun.

Below are posts that share my tips or experiences with flavors of Linux.
