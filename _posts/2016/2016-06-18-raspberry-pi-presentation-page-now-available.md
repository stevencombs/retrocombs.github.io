On June 17th, I was the guest speaker for our local [Columbus area Chamber of Commerce TANK Talk](https://www.facebook.com/events/1271805972849192/). I was asked to give a presentation about the Raspberry Pi and its use in physical computing, making and education. I decided to expand the presentation to include other physical computing devices such as the Arduino and a Kickstarter project.

A companion page is available that includes my electronic presentation and links to the numerous resources I shared. The page is located at:

The page also includes a comments area if you have questions. If you would like me to present this information, or a modified version, to your group, [send me an email](mailto:steven.combs@gmail.com).

Shout out and huge thanks to the [Columbus Area Chamber](http://www.columbusareachamber.com/) and the [Fish Tank Co-working Space](http://www.columbusareachamber.com/spotlight/fishtank) for inviting me to present.
