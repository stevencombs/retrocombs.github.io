Today I unveil the first in a new theme of posts, **retroCombs**. This theme is devoted to my love of retro computing and gaming. I have a [couple of retro posts](https://www.stevencombs.com/retro) on the blog, but now I have a [brand theme](https://youtu.be/iVw_ZBVBk7g) to tie them together. The first post to receive the brand is part one of a new series on the [Commodore Plus/4 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Plus/4).

> **MEMBERSHIP:** I now offer retroCombs memberships from $1 (PET level membership) to $20 (MEGA65 level membership) that include levels in between for all budgets (VIC-20, C64, Plus/4, and C128). If you'd like to support my content and get access to my Discord server along with other cool freebies, check out each level at <https://www.buymeacoffee.com/retroCombs>.

## Series Information

This episode is part of a series. You can read the entire series and view additional resources at:

<https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4>

## Companion Disk Image

As I progress through the user's manual, I enter and execute sample programs. The link below is to a `.d81` image that contains every program from each episode. **Currently, the image is not complete since we still have several chapters to go.**

[retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image](/plus4/plus4-users-manual.d81) - **UPDATED AS OF:** 2020-11-01

I use the following file name convention to make it easy to locate specific programs:

<img src="/images/design/floppy-disk-small.png" align="right">Sample Program Name: `02 RCOMBS SCROLL.PRG`

* `02` - The chapter number
* `RCOMBS SCROLL` - my self assigned name for the BASIC program which will be immediately identifiable if you follow along.

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've taken the time to scan each chapter so you can read and follow along. Use the link below for this episode's chapter:

## YouTube Video: _retroCombs: Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual, Chapter 0 - Open the Box_

The video below describes my background with Commodore computers, my intent for this new series, and an open the box on a Commodore Plus/4. Watch the video and then come back and read the additional material posted below the video.

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key     | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:--------|:--------------|:-----|:------------|
| `‚á™`     | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `[C=]`  | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `‚åÉ`     | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `‚éã`     | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `‚åÇ`     | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `‚å´`     | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `‚èé`     | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `‚áß`     | Shift         | `‚ê£`  | Space       |
| `‚Üë`     | Cursor Up     | `‚Üì`  | Cursor Down |
| `‚Üí`     | Cursor Right  | `‚Üê`  | Cursor Left |

## Episode Errata

THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR THE FEEDBACK!!! It makes this project more fun and I'm (re)learning  much. I will add video corrections or additions below.

## Random Thoughts

I look forward to diving into the Commodore Plus/4. This 8-bit computer has eluded me for years. I know it is going to be a very different experience from my earlier VIC-20, 64, and 128. The lack of focus on gaming with an increased emphasis on business should be an interesting study. I'm excited to explore what appears to be a more functional basic programming language complete with dedicated graphics commands, file functions, and machine language monitor (all missing from the VIC-20 and C64).

> NOTE: While writing this post, I found the [Commodore Plus/4 Wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_Plus/4). It will become an excellent resource during this series.

One experiment I will conduct, is to use the Plus/4's keyboard and word processor to write a blog post. This will involve typing the post (in Markdown) on the Plus/4 and then finding a way to move the text to a modern PC. I'm open to ideas now if anyone has them!

I hope readers and watchers enjoy the series. I may not post as regularly as I like, and I may use YouTube Live on a whim to capture live experiences, so make sure you subscribe to my [blog](https://www.stevencombs.com/rss), [Twitter feed](https://www.twitter.com/stevencombs), and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs) if you want the full experience.

I want this to be a collaborative project. If you are an experienced Plus/4 aficionado, please share your ideas, thoughts on the content, and where I might easily (and inexpensively) locate peripherals for this device. I'd even appreciate if you have spares lying around, sending them my way.

If you are new to the device like I am, post your questions and ideas for what you would like to see. Also let me know if you are following along. Let's make this a community project. For now, Leave your comments and thoughts below or in the comments [under the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/_faxuAlFHII).
