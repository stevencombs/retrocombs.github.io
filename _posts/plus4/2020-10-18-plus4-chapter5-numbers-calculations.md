In this Commodore Plus/4 retroCombs episode, I cover chapter 5 of the Commodore Plus/4 user's manual. In this chapter, _Number and Calculation_, I learn how to use the Plus/4 as a calculator in immediate mode, create a function, and learn more about working with numbers in Commodore BASIC 3.5. I even combine some things we learned in previous chapters to amp up our programs. It is a packed chapter and even though I'm no math teacher;Getting Started_ I, "begin to acquaint you with some of the characteristics and capabilities of the Plus/4, and how to take the first steps toward programming with your computer." We spend more time learning how to use the keyboard, correcting mistakes, creating simple programs, and then I shope I do the concepts justice. This is one chapter where I find the User's Manual a bit lacking but adequatew you how to use windows on the Plus/4. No, not the operating system, but another unique feature of the Plus/4's BASIC.

## Series Information

## Video Errata

Robin, from [8-Bit Show and Tell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gRBswFkuteshdwMZAQafQ) points out:

    I'm enjoying this! At about 14:30 you mention how integer variables are truncated if assigned a float - this is correct, but then you say that 12.75 would be rounded to 13; it would actually be truncated to 12. Even 12.99999 would be truncated to 12 if assigned to an integer variable. If you want rounding, you'd need to do something like A% = 12.75 + 0.5. The INT() function isn't needed, but may improve readability.

Thanks for the catch and correction, Robin!

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key  | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:---- |:------------- |:---- |:----------- |
| `‚á™`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `‚åÉ`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `‚éã`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `‚åÇ`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `‚å´`  | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `‚èé`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `‚áß`  | Shift         | `‚ê£`  | Space       |

## Episode Errata

No feedback from previous episode. I must have gotten most things correct!

## Introduction

1. Thanks to all my viewers for the feedback.
2. .d81 disk image is now available [here](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4#companion-disk-image).link).
3. Proud of the companion website for this episode. Check it out!

I'm going to feel a bit like a math teacher in this episode! But an easy one. No homework.

## Numbers and Basic Operations

1. We'll talk about mathematical operators, but relational operators should appear when get deeper into programming. Operators are shown in the image below:

    ![Basic Mathematical and Relational Operators](/plus4/images/operators-slide.png)

## Fractions and Decimals

1. Fractions are not native to the Commodore Basic 3.5. A fraction such as 1/2 is converted to decimal form (.5). The Plus/4 will never display a result in fraction format.
2. Pi, or `œÄ`, is a key on the Plus/4 keyboard (which is unique since most keyboards today don't have this key). Press it to represent the value of œÄ in a calculation.

## Scientific Notation

1. Numbers larger than nine digits are represented using scientific notation. Here are some examples:

    ```realbasic
    20 = 2E+1
    10500 = 1.05E+5
    .0666 = 6.66E-2
    ```

## Performing Calculations

1. We can use a `PRINT` command in a BASIC program to perform calculations as shown in the example below:

    ```realbasic
    10 ? 1+2,2-1
    20 ? 2*2,4/2
    ```

2. You can print both a calculation, the result of a calculation, or the calculation and the result in a line of BASIC code as shown below:

    ```realbasic
    10 ? "2001/2010"
    20 ? 2*3
    30 ? "2*3+1=";2*3+1
    ```

## Immediate (Direct) Mode

1. Immediate mode allows us to use the Plus/4 like a calculator without creating a BASIC program and using the `RUN` command. Enter the calculation on a new line preceded by the `PRINT` command or the `?` character. Below are a few examples:

    > **TIP:** ? = PRINT in Commodore BASIC)

    ```realbasic
    ? 3-6 ‚èé
    -3
    ? 24/(6+2) ‚èé
     3
    ```

2. Let's combine what we've learned to use immediate mode to display a calculation and a result. Type the line below on an empty line:

    ```realbasic
    ? "2 TO THE 3RD POWER EQUALS";2‚Üë3 ‚èé
    ```

## Order of Calculation

1. Commodore Basic 3.5 uses the mathematical concept of [order of operations](order of operations). In the example below, 50/5 is performed first with 200 added after the result:

    ```realbasic
    ? 200+50/5
    ```

2. Below is a short summary of precedence of operators:

    * **FIRST:** Negative numbers identified
    * **SECOND:** Solve exponents
    * **THIRD:** Solve multiplication and division
    * **FOURTH:** Solve addition and subtraction

3. To modify the precedence of operators, surround the values between `(` and `)` as shown in the example below. The operation `A/3` will complete, followed by `12 +` the value of `A/3`, and then that result multiplied by 36.

    ```realbasic
    ? 36*(12+(A/3))
    ```

## Using Variables

1. Variable are an important concept to both algebra and programming.
2. A variable is a placeholder for a value.
3. There are three types of variables in Commodore BASIC as shown in the table below:

TYPE           | SYMBOL | DESCRIPTION                     | EXAMPLES  | SAMPLE VALUES
:--------------|:-------|:--------------------------------|:----------|:-------------------------
Floating Point | n/a    | Real (Decimal) or Whole Numbers | X, AB, T4 | 23.5, 12, 1.3E+2
Integer        | %      | Whole Numbers                   | X%, AI%   | 15, 102, 3
Text String    | $      | Letters, Numbers, Characters    | X$, MS$   | "TOTAL:" , "DAY 1", "CBM"won't spend time on relational operators. They should appear again in a programming chapter.

1. Be sure to **LIKE** each video and **SUBSCRIBE** to the [channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs)! The community is slowly growing.

## Numeric Functions

1. Commodore BASIC 3.5 includes numeric functions such as the trigonometric SIN function. A listing can be found on page 151 along with all other Commodore BASIC commands.
2. A function uses the format: `FUNCTION(X)` where function equals a specific function (such as SIN) and the `X` between the `(` and `)` is a specific value the function will act upon.
3. Below is a sample program that uses the `SQR(X)` function, or Square Root of a number to print the square root of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:

    ```realbasic
    10 FOR X=1TO5
    20 ?"THE SQUARE ROOT OF";X;"IS";SQR(X)
    30 NEXT X
    ```
    **üíæ On Disk:** `05 SQUARE ROOT`

## Numbers and Other Functions

1. Random numbers are important for simulation and game software.
2. Commodore Basic includes a `RND(X)` function to produce random numbers within a range of values.
3. Below is a sample program that will print five random values.

    ```realbasic
    10 FOR X = 1 TO 5 : ? RND(X): NEXT X
    ```

    > **TIP:** The line of code above could have been three different lines; however, we use a `:` to place three lines of code on a single line. This can reduce memory usage for longer programs.

4. The program above creates five unique random numbers, but what if we want random numbers between 1 and 5? We will need to use the `INT(X)` function as well as setting a range (5) and lower limit (+1) as shown in the program below:

    ```realbasic
    10 FOR X = 1 TO 5
    20 ? INT(5*RND(1))+1 : REM 5 IS THE RANGE & +1 IS THE     LOWER LIMIT
    30 NEXT X
    ```
    **üíæ On Disk:** `05 RANDOM 1-5`

5. It is also possible to create your own unique function to use throughout a program. If the function is used regularly in a program, this can save memory and speed of operation. Below is an example of a program below that will alternate a line of text on the screen various colors:

    ```realbasic
    10 DEF FNR(X)=INT(X*RND(1))+1
    20 DO
    30 COLOR 1,FNR(16),5 : REM PICK A COLOR FROM 1 TO 16
    40 ? "THE SEARCH GOES ON..."
    50 LOOP
    ```
    **üíæ On Disk:** `05 FUNCTION`

    > HINT: The DO/LOOP commands create an infinite loop. Press `RS` to stop the program.

## Final Thoughts

This chapter provides the cursory basics of number and calculations. I recommend you check out more functions on page 151 in the user's manual. Of particular interest is that most of the examples I provide can be accomplished using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter on a modern computer. On that note, the concepts used here will help anyone who wants to learn program BASICs (pun intended).ic Functions
