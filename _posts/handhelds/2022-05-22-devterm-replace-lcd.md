In a previous Clockwork Pi DevTerm assembly video, I my LCD panel was broken and I had to hack the panel in order to get it working; however, Clockwork was quick to send out a replacement and during a 2022-05-01 livestream, I replaced my hacked up LCD screen with the new one.

The video below is a 27 minute edit of the longer one hour and thirteen minutes livestream.

A huge shout-out to [Clockwork](https://www.clockworkpi.com), and Alex, for the opportunity to experience the DevTerm. They sent their top-of-the-line DevTerm, the A06, to me at no cost. That's a $340 value and I am under no obligation to provide a positive review. My thoughts are my own. Thanks again, Clockwork, for supporting my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs) and [blog]()!

## TRS-80 Model 100 Similarities and Emulator

After I install the replacement LCD panel, I compare the DevTerm to a TRS-80 Model 100. I don't show how to install the software (a later video), but I demonstrate the [VirtualT TRS-80 Model 100 emulator optimized for the DevTerm](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/virtualt-tandy-trs-80-model-100-emulator-for-devterm-a06-a04/8296).

The emulator has a few quirks, but it's good! More on this emulator in the future.

## DevTerm Specifications

There are various models of the DevTerm. The model sent to me by Clockwork was the A06 that includes:

![DevTerm Iso shot](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4WnC4VIqa4xhLrJXaZ3KTvizC7MArtkkIEktINEUDdS6bBSiUKBlB1dqTG9DdHV5EZ_OpcE7aegxpUjBLP4=w782-h440-rw)

- ClockworkPi v3.14 mainboard
- A-06 Core module (ARM64-bit Dual-core Cortex-A72 + Quad-core Cortex-A53, Mali-T864, 4GB LPDDR4)
- Ext. module that includes additional ports
- 6.86-inch IPS screen module
- Clockwork 65% keyboard
- Battery module (batteries not included)
- Dual speakers
- 58mm 200dpi thermal printer component
- Shells and bracket system
- 32GB high-speed TF-card with clockworkOS

The A06 model includes plenty of ports:

- 3 USB B
- 1 USB C
- 1 Micro HDMI
- 1 3.5mm headphone
- 1 Micro SD Card
- 1 Thermal printer expansion port

It‚Äôs a fun and capable gadget if you can get past the 65% keyboard.

## Crushed Ribbon Cable

Below is an image of the crushed/split ribbon cable. I did not show this in the video.

Thanks again to Clockwork for immediately shipping a replacement. While waiting, I grabbed my ohm meter, an X-Acto knife, wire, and soldering iron and got to work.

With the tip of the knife, I lightly scratched the plastic from the ribbon cable to expose the conductive material underneath. I used the ohmmeter to test across the ribbon cable to the connector on the LED driver board. Once I had enough of the ribbon cable exposed to make a consistent circuit, I soldered a small wire to the ribbon cable and then to the LED driver board. I connected it to the DevTerm, turned it on, and after about 10 seconds, the display LEDs turned on.

## More DevTerm Content?

As I mention during the video, I have even more content I want to produce for the DevTerm that includes:

- Install Xemu (the MEGA65 emulator)
- Install EmulationStation
- Further Model 100 Comparisons
