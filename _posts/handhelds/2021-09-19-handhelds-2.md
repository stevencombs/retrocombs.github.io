After recording an upcoming TI 99/4A video (stay tuned), I was chatting with supporter, [Mislav](https://twitter.com/KrlezaMislav) and he asked when my next livestream would happen. I told him I had two handheld consoles on my desk, but wasn't sure when I would have time to share them. My TI 99/4A recording was smooth, and I found time late on this Sunday afternoon.

I fired up OBS Studio and then realized, during my last livestream, I had a brand new Adafruit MacroPad ready to configure and use as a "Streamdeck." After 20 minutes, I had the Circuit Python code ready to switch between OBS screens during livestreams. The device makes its premiere at the beginning of this video but if you want a good look at the MacroPad, check out my [previous livestream](https://www.stevencombs.com/adabox-019).

With the MacroPad ready for action, I began streaming. During this livestream, I shared the following handheld consoles:

In the video below, I unbox and turn on two brand new retro handheld gaming consoles.

## Video Errata

I tried to show what's on the LiNKFOR micro SD card. In the video, I claim the volume would not mount and I was correct. I did not plug it into the Mac mini but a charger. Ouch!

## Final Thoughts

The MacroPad is recommended for your next livestream. When they are back in stock, grab one for $45. It's cheaper than a [six button stream deck](https://amzn.to/3tVZ6Za), includes more buttons, and you configure it with almost an unlimited number of macros for specific applications.

The LiNKFOR is the winner. Along with a common selection of 8 and 16 bit retro-gaming consoles, it surprised me to find that is supports Atari, Amiga, DOS, and PC computer emulators but sadly, not Commodore. It appears this device supports Frodo (a Commodore 64 emulator) since it uses the OPENDINGUX media platform. I'll try to install this emulator later; however, it surprised me to find an excellent selection of retro computer emulators. I thought I would write this device off in favor of the Great Boy.

The negative for this device is the strange decision to use a mini USB port. Not a micro USB, which is already out of date, but a mini which hasn't been in use regularly for over 10 years. It is an odd choice and means you will need another USB cable in your travel bag.

I will put the screen protector on. I was shocked to find the bare LCD screen exposed. No wonder LiNKFOR includes a thick plastic screen protector. If you are looking for a handheld gaming console with more capabilities, including video, ebook (in .txt format), and images, this device can handle it. This device is more full featured than the [Trimui/Powkiddy A66](https://amzn.to/3AtbZwe) I reviewed earlier. At $60, this device is a fun stocking stuffer for that retro-gaming fan in your life.

The Great Boy is a follow-up to the [earlier Great Boy](https://amzn.to/2XEhM3L) I reviewed. It includes an enhanced game loader, a micro SD card for unlimited games, and a faster processor. It gets rid of the annoying language screen and background music. At around $15 more, and while I liked the first version, I recommend this newer version over the old version. The form factor is similar, and the only notable changes are the locations of ports and shoulder buttons for navigation and gameplay. Thankfully, it includes a micro USB port.

I'm not yet sure which media system these devices use. I'll research, but it appears you can add games after you remove the SD card reader sticker that voids your return warranty. While you can add games, I suspect we cannot add emulators. Still, this is a great little device, at a fair price; however, for $10 more, go for the LiNKFOR.

This is most likely my last handheld gaming console video. These are not popular with my viewers and they don't bring in any new viewers. There is a new MEGAPhone in development from the MEGA team. That device might bring me back to handheld game console videos; however, that device is several years away. If you'd like to try to change my mind, drop a comment below.
