In [my last handheld gaming console post](/great-boy), I shared the my Amazon Prime day 2021 experience and the lure of handheld game consoles. In that post, I describe my use of the [RetroFlag RPi Case](https://amzn.to/2V4QlOZ) for handheld retro-gaming and use this as a baseline for all other handheld consoles I will share.

You can view my [Install Super RetroPie on the Retroflag GPi Case](/gpicase) blog post and companion video for more information. The [GPi case](https://amzn.to/3Au3f9A) is a wonderful handheld gaming device when paired with the [Super RetroPie distribution](https://mega.nz/folder/Ai5inYJa#mR2BXoPX9jnVCn42jqRjIQ).

As a reminder, I chose four different handheld game units that range in price from $10 to $50. I had ‚âà$120 of affiliate funds that became my budget for this experiment (Thanks to everyone who supports the [blog]() and the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs)!). These include:

1. [Great Boy Portable Handheld Games for Kids Preloaded 380 Classic Retro Games with 3.5'' Big Color Display and Gamepad Rechargeable Arcade Gaming System](https://amzn.to/3xfJQ9u)
2. [Handheld Game Console 390 Classic Games LiNKFOR Retro Mini Game Player with 3 Inch LCD Color Screen Rechargeable Battery Portable Retro Video Game Console Support for Connecting TV and Two Players](https://amzn.to/3zZoOOc)
3. [FateFan Retro Game Console with 500 Classic Games, Handheld Game Console Supporting 2 Players TV Connection, 1020 mAh Rechargeable Battery(Green)](https://amzn.to/3lgk0zK)
4. [TRIMUI Handheld Game Console with 4000+ Classical Games, Super Mini Retro Games Console Arcade, Mini Retro Gaming Player 2.0" IPS, Powkiddy Portable Video Game Console 600MA(Gray)](https://amzn.to/3BB7QGC)

üïπÔ∏è Want to extend your gameplay for items 1 through 4? Purchase additional [BL-5C 3.7V 1020mAh Rechargeable Batteries](https://amzn.to/3zXcgqr).

üïπÔ∏è Items 1 to 3 include RCA out. If your TV doesn't support RCA out, use this [RCA to HDMI Convertor](https://amzn.to/3fjnRZ3).

> **NOTE:** This page uses Amazon Affiliate Links. Thanks for your continued support of this blog and [companion videos](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs).

In part two of my four part retro-computing handheld series, I open the box, turn on, and play games on the LiNKFOR.

## Retro Gaming Handhelds Comparison Table

Each unit has unique features and I found it difficult to compare them without a table. My table is in the embedded Google Sheet below or view directly by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18F2VdasK79-lrjHz8jJKqSnqtliHu4gak_LHxMsmsMA/edit?usp=sharing).

## LiNKFOR Retro Mini Game Player

The [LiNKFOR](https://amzn.to/3CajJnS) advertises ten more games than the Great Boy; however, it came with 500; however there are some duplicates. The Amazon Prime Day price was $8.79 compared to the normal price of $10.90.

A search for LiNKFOR on Amazon reveals the brand is used for audio/video products such as ‚Ä¶

### LiNKFOR Features

This is the first unit I look at that has the Gameboy's vertical form factor, in other words, the hand cramper! Yuck.

- Vertical form factor
- Directional joystick and controller pad
- 3" screen
- Internal rechargeable battery
- Two player mode with additional game pad
- Headphone jack
- Connect to TV with AV cable

Those features are similar to the first unit, save for the vertical form factor and smaller screen. As shown in the video, the LiNKFOR uses a [Spansion](https://www.cypress.com)‚Äì[71PL256NCOHFW5U Processor](https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/164744/SPANSION/S71PL256NC0.html). I anticipated this processor would be the same as the Great Boy. Surprisingly, it was different. The link above is to the specification sheet if you want to read more.

**Game Notes:** What's with Galaga Plus? Small ship and large blasts? Item 285 is not Paperboy, so don't purchase if you consider this game a must. There are several

### LiNKFOR Thoughts

Things to like about the LiNKFOR include:

1. Low cost! This things is only $10.
2. Pocket size and light (almost too light).
3. Includes extra controller for two-player action.
4. Good battery life.
5. A/V out cable to play on larger screens.

If there are a few games you like of the 500, you are sure to get value. This would make a great stocking stuffer or holiday party gift exchange item; especially if you knew there was a retro game fan in the mix.

Things to improve the LiNKFOR include:

> **NOTE:** I understand this is a $10 device and improvements may not be possible at that price point.

1. Change the annoying menu music or eliminate.
2. Omit requirement to select language on each reset or power‚Äìon.
3. Fix control action ‚Äì especially on maze games such as Pac Man III.
4. Allow option to hold buttons to move quickly through menus.
4. Include a better system to locate games.
5. Scroll 20 character menu title names.
6. Correct title names. 238‚Üí240, are not as listed ‚Äì in this case Mario Bothers is listed as Kamikaze!
7. Place titles in alphabetical order and groupings.
8. Remove duplicate games reduce total number from 500 to ??? ‚Äì and I'm not going to figure it out!
9. Design better "non-mushy" controls that don't caused as many "game over" moments.

That concludes the look at the LiNKFOR. Up next is the FateFan Retro Game Console; also with 500 games. Let's see if the same 500 games included with the LiNKFOR are the same in the similar form factor FateFan handheld.

## Conclusion, Comparison, and Recommendation

I'll compare all four of the handhelds and make a final recommendation in the final video (link coming soon). For now, I hope you enjoy this fun experiment. While not every handheld is a winner, trying them out makes every experience like Christmas morning!
