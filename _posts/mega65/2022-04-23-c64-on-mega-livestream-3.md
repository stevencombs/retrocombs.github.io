This is the companion blog post for my 2022-04-03 live stream edit; _Part III: Playing the C64 demos from the MEGA65 on boarding SD Card_. This is a short edit of a much longer live stream where I continue my look at the "b-side" of the MEGA65 onboarding SD card that includes a C64 disk image full of games and demos to run on the MEGA65 in Commodore 64 mode. We've run through the games and this video is all demos! Before the demos, I unbox a few items that will appear in future content and a gift from one of my producers.

If you need to get caught up, be sure and check out parts I and II. Here are the details:

## RRRPs

I unbox three items purchased from AliExpress and I'm likely never to purchase from them again. Long arrival times make me forget what I ordered! I'm using Amazon links below for faster shipping.

1. $10 [ITEM](link) - To use with OBS studio but these work to capture the MEGA65.

## B-Side Commodore C64 Demos Continued

Below is a list of the demos I share along with thoughts and links. We'll start with the games (the programs on the disk image above the line).

> **NOTE:** `LOAD` commands include blank space and I represent these with the `␣` character.

**IRATA** - This [2013 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=126825) celebrates 30 years of IRATA in the demo scene via an impressive mix of sound and graphics that even though on an 8-bit display, looks modern.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "RAB-IRATA IBA"`

**RGBA** - [This trippy 2011 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=101647) looks great at the start but gets the party going once the large Commodore logo appears on the screen.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "RGBA"`

**4K PETSCII Intro** - With a name like 4K PETSCII, [this 2019 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=180319) has to be good and it does not disappoint. With bright colors and PETSCII characters, Genesis Project (GP) includes a fun soundtrack.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "GP - 4K PETSCII"`

**The Earth** - If you load [this 2018 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=173345) and expect anything a revolving earth, this is the demo for you. In addition to the aforementioned earth, this demo includes music, not my favorite, with credits and greetings that orbit the earth.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "THE EARTH"`

**C64 Invitation** - Fishbone's first, and short, [2010 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=88168) is a good one and there's even a shoutout to those in the ZX Spectrum demo scene. The text choice is interesting and the swipe to erase is smooth.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "C64INVITATION"`

**Prologue** - [This fun 2021 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=208247) looks like an anime inspired fighting game introduction more than a demo from the scene. This one could be lifted off the screen of a Gameboy Color system.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "PROLOGUE"`

**BEEP!** - I'm confused. The name of this is BEEP! - DREAM; however, the screen says displays Dream and then [Silly Venture 2021](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3100). Is this a mash up? Leave a comment and let me know. I had a hard time figuring this one out.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "BEEP!     -DREAM"`

**Oldskool Forever 2** - The Roadrunner makes a cameo in this demo that starts with a cool transition from the C64 blue screen into the demo world. I was unable to find a link to this one. If you have more info, please leave a comment below.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "0LDSK00L 4EVER 2"`

**Conservative** - [This conservative 2012 demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=110508) starts with, go figure, a conservative Commodore 64 screen and then warns the user that the "hippies" should look elsewhere as the propaganda appears on non-conservative screens that divulge into a static filled screen of individual words.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "CONSERVATIVE"`

**GUBBDATA 2020** - One of [the most fun audio and visual demos](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=187989) in this group, this is what would happen if you added Statler or Waldorf to a Commodore 64 demo.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "GUBBDATA 2020/GP"`

**PETSCII TRIP** - If the Ghostbusters drove a Commodore themed car, this is what it would look like. All PETSCII from 2019, this demo (created in 10 days) tells the story of a trip through PETSCII land. Even though PETSCII characters are used, this one reminds me of a Lucas Arts adventure game.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "PETSCII-TRIP"`

**Smile** - A [tribute to Bárd](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=172574), this 2018 demo loads with a flashing boarder a unique text scroll that ends with what I assume is an image of Bárd. I didn't know him, but this demo paints him as an inspiring spirit loved by many. Everyone needs their own demo and with 8-bit music this good.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "SMILE-TO-THE-SKY"`

**Dirty Harry** - Go ahead, make my demo! You get what you expect if you were looking for Dirty Harry shooting space invaders game characters in this 2007 demo. This is the only demo that you can exit gracefully by tapping the space bar. There is text at the beginning that I captured for you below:

```
24 MAY 2007. {A} NEW INTRO BY CRYPT. THX
TO A-MAN/XENON FOR THE COOL MUSIC. BOOST
ING BASS !!!    BTW DONT ASK ME WHY BUT
THE SOUND BUGS ON EMULATORS
```

If anyone knows more about this demo, please share in the comments below.

LOAD Command: `LOAD "DIRTYHARRY"`

And that concludes our look at the demos on the MEGA65 SD Card onboarding image!

## Final Thoughts

We did it! We reviewed every demo and game on the B-side of the MEGA65 onboarding SD card. When you receive your MEGA65, make sure to visit these games and demos again. We only scratched the surface of this software and you will want to spend more time to explore all the features these titles offer.

The C64 disk image is a nice addition to the MEGA65. It is my understanding that they prepared the SD Cards for the spring release of the MEGA65. It is unlikely any of the titles will change, but what's included is a nice way to highlight C64 mode. If you have interest, leave your comments below or under the video.
