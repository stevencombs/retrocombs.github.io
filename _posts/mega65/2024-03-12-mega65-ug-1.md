## ABOUT THE USER'S GUIDE

The original manual was included with the first batch of MEGA65s delivered in 2022. Since then, the MEGA65 has continued to receive core and hardware updates. In 2024, in anticipation of the next MEGA65 batch release scheduled for the Summer, the MEGA65 team released version two of the guide, which I'll be using for this video series. Even if you don't own a MEGA65, there are three ways you can get your own guide:

1. Download the [PDF version](https://mega65.org/user-guide).
2. Visit Lulu and [order a printed version](https://www.lulu.com/shop/dan-sanderson-and-edilbert-kirk-and-paul-gardner-stephen/mega65-users-guide/paperback/product-dyrzzzy.html?page=1&pageSize=4).
3. [Order a MEGA65](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0765-06-T001CK-MEGA65-highly-advanced-C64-and-C65-compatible-8-bit-computer?c=564), and you'll find one in the box when it arrives.

The User's Guide is one volume in an entire library of free MEGA65 PDF books available, including:

- The MEGA65 User's Guide: <https://mega65.org/user-guide> - The volume I'll cover in this video series.
- The MEGA65 Developer's Guide: <https://mega65.org/developer-guide> - Information to help you write programs for the MEGA65.
- The MEGA65 BASIC 65 Reference: <https://mega65.org/basic65-ref> - BASIC 65 commands, functions, and operations documentation.
- The MEGA65 Chipset Reference: <https://mega65.org/chipset-ref> - Information about the MEGA65's custom chips.
- The MEGA65 Complete Compendium: <https://mega65.org/mega65-book> - All volumes in a single PDF.

For more information, you can visit the [MEGA65 Confluence Wiki](https://mega65.org/docs). Once again, all the links you need are in the video description and on my own [MEGA65 Resource](https://www.retrocombs.com/mega65).

## WELCOME TO THE MEGA65

Congratulations on your purchase of the MEGA65! That seems like an appropriate welcome, right? And that's how Chapter one of the user's guide begins, but let's dig a little deeper into the MEGA65's history.

Remember the Commodore 64? That iconic 80s computer that launched countless gaming and coding adventures? Imagine if its planned successor, the 1990s Commodore 65, had actually been released. That project may have been shelved, but thanks to a dedicated team of retro enthusiasts, that dream is now a reality in a computer called the MEGA65! Together with the MEGA65 development team, I created an [An Introduction to the MEGA65](https://youtu.be/Vr9rLUQZgJI) video. Go watch that video now. Don't worry, I'll be right here when you come back.

Great video, right? Glad you liked it.

As you learned, the MEGA65 is a living, breathing project. It's constantly evolving with community-driven updates that expand its capabilities. Whether you pine for a Commodore 64 or 128 successor, you missed the 8-bit era and want to see what the fuss is about, or you're a tech enthusiast excited about what you can create with an FPGA, the MEGA65 is for you.

And because the MEGA65 is under active development with a thriving community, I have a feeling the newer chapters in the MEGA65 User's Guide are yet to be written!

## JOIN THE COMMUNITY

To get the most out of the MEGA65, you really need to join the aforementioned community. I can tell you, first-hand, that the MEGA65 community is a fun, informative, and supportive group and you can find them in two primary locations:

1. The MEGA65 Discord: <https://mega65.org/chat>
2. The MEGA65 Forum: <https://mega65.org/forum>

Which ever way you choose to interact with the community, you'll find the latest information, tips, tricks, and supportive community.

## CONCLUSION

I hope this post and the companion video piques your interest in the MEGA65 and you'll choose to follow me along this exciting journey through the MEGA65 User's Guide. I'll post the next chapter soon. In the meantime, hit like, subscribe, and alerts so you don't miss the next chapter.
