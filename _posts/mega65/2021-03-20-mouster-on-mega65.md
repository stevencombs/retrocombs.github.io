In this FAST LOAD, I try to get the new mouSTer from Retrohax.net working with my MEGA65 Developer Kit. Watch the video below and then come back to this blog post to see if I was successful. Spoiler alert; at first the device did not work; however, I get this wonderful USB HID to DB9 connection device working, and it's not as hard as I imagined.

> **MEMBERSHIP:** I now offer retroCombs memberships from $1 (PET level membership) to $20 (MEGA65 level membership) that include levels in between for all budgets (VIC-20, C64, Plus/4, and C128).

## YouTube Video: _FAST LOAD: Use the Retrohax.net mouSTer on the MEGA65_

In the video below, I connect a mouSTer to a MEGA65 and see if it works.

## Final Thoughts

Below are additional mouSTer thoughts and information I did not include or elaborate on in the video.

1. Unfortunately, as of 2021-03-20, the mouSTer is out of stock. They were limited when I snagged one; however, I hoped they would be back in stock by the time I shared my video. Keep checking. I'm sure they'll return.
2. The mouSTer is encased in what appears to be a silicone sleeve. I like it; however, if you want to print your own case, check out [The mouSTer project ‚Äì another UPDATE - retrohax.net](https://retrohax.net/the-mouster-project-another-update/). On this page are links to a case you can print. It looks bulky to me; however, it does give me an idea for my own case. Hmm...
3. I originally conceived this video as a longer demonstration of the MEGA65. I decided against this longer video in lieu of a FAST LOAD. I have some other content to create for the MEGA65, so stay tuned.
4. The VictSing mouse I use in the video is my daily driver on my new M1 Mac mini. It's a great mouse, at a great cost ([around $35](https://amzn.to/3vJWmyd)). What I love about it is that not only does it include additional buttons, it can be used in either Bluetooth or USB dongle mode - very versatile!
5. I did not take any time to discuss the options available in the `.ini` file that the mouSTer creates on the USB drive. I include the file contents at the bottom of this post. The comment statements serve as a manual for the device. That's pretty slick when you think about it. When you upgrade the firmware, you get the updated instruction manual!

That's all for now but I do often add thoughts later. If I do, they will be date stamped.

## Bonus MOUSTER.INI contents (Firmware v3.11.1962)

Below is the `.ini` included with the firmware. I provide so those without a mouSTer can review the contents prior to purchase, or while waiting. It might help readers make a purchase decision. I also plan to use this page instead of constantly looking for my USB drive.

```bash
; mouSTer - universal USB HID class device to db9 adapter.

; ###############################-Blink-Codes-###################################
;
; mouSTer is communicating with you using MORSE CODE or simply blinking the LED.
; List of possible messages:
;
; Very fast blinking: Bootloader is Active and is waiting for USB drive with new firmware.
; If USB drive is not detected within 2s, main program will be launched.
;
; Normal blinking: mouSTer is ready, and is awaiting USB HID device (mouse, game pad etc).
;
; HeartBeat: 2 fast blinks and long pause. mouSTer is alive and operational.
;
; SOS: <... --- ...> Critical problem has occurred. Not possible to recover from this state. Please cycle power.
;
; E: <.> An error has occurred. Remove USB device | Check INI file syntax.
;
; R: <.-.> Operation successfully finished. Remove the USB device.
;
; ##############################-Using-an-USB-Drive-##############################
;
; When USB drive is inserted, mouSTer is looking for a 'mouSTer' folder.
; If the folder does not exists, it will be created and opened.
; Then mouSTer is looking for configuration file: 'mouSTer.ini'
; If exists, configuration will be read and parsed then written to memory.
; If no ini file is present, mouSTer is looking for new firmware file: 'mouSTer.fw'.
; If firmware file is present mouSTer will activate the bootloader, and install new firmware.
; In case if no ini nor firmware present - mouSTer will write (this) ini file
; with manual and current firmware version on the top - into 'mouSTer.ini' file.
;
; mouSTer is case insensitive.
;
; mouSTer config   file: '/mouSTer/mouSTer.ini'
; mouSTer firmware file: '/mouSTer/mouSTer.fw'
;
; most up to date information and the latest firmware is always available at: http://Jil.guru/mouSTer
