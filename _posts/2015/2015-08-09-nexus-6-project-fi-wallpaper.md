I've been on the hunt for wallpaper for my Nexus 6 Project Fi phone. There are very few available and my preference is to highlight the Fi logo and add a touch of material design to match Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. I decided to fire up iDraw on my Mac and create my own. What I came up with was a design that was clean, colorful and minimalist.

{UPDATE: Aug 23, 2015} Many commented that my original wallpaper was not configured for the stock Google Now launcher. I have corrected this and I will now only create versions for the stock launcher.

I have ideas for other wallpaper. Be sure to check back for other versions. I'd love to see your home screen layout with my wallpaper design. Post those in the comments below for all to see.
