I'm often asked what electronic devices we use on a regular basis. This post lists those devices and provides a bit of information about their use and location in our home. This is a live, and very unorganized, list that I will update regularly as new devices become favored and old devices fall out of favor. Old devices will remain in the list; however, they will receive <strike>strike through</strike> highlighting. There are copious hyperlinks through the list. Some will take you to a purchase page and others will simply provide further information on an older device.

| Device                                                                                                                                                                                               | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It provides timely, and selected, notifications and lets me control my audio while driving, walking or running. Its a great wearable for Android users and an okay device for iOS users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Since the purchase of  a large screen Nexus 6, I find myself using the iPad Air less and less. Still, for long form reading, it is the best device I own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

She uses it to read ebooks, scan her work email and play a few casual games. She's not asked for an upgrade and she's not had a single complaint. Recently she's expressed interest in the new 12 inch iPad Pro. It may be time for an upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This thing still sounds great. The Yamaha setup configures the sound bar to match your room layout. The speakers inside the sound bar actually move to disperse the surround sound channels around the room!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It serves a single purpose, to DVR local network programming. We have a basic Comcast plan that includes only local cable channels, high speed internet and HBO (didn't ask for it, but have it anyway). If we were to live in an area were I could mount an aerial antenna or an indoor antenna would capture all the network stations, I would get rid of cable all together.                                                                                                                                                |

We don't view content from the Mac mini, but use it as a [Plex server](https://plex.tv/) to stream our ripped DVDs to the televisions in our home and our mobile devices. It also hosts an Apple Server and [iSyncr](http://www.jrtstudio.com/iSyncr-iTunes-for-Android) to sync our iTunes library to my Nexus 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It's a great television that is very thin with a thin bezel. It too has smart features, but like the Sony television, we never use them in favor of a more modern device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We also use it to view Amazon Prime, Netflix, Plex and Sling TV content. The television in our living room is not connected to cable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

While watching a show on Amazon Prime, the Fire HD presents information about the movie, actors and even trivia. Look for a sale and you can probably snag one for around $70-$80. For live show, install the Twitter app, search for the live tweets hashtag and join others watching the same show.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In 2012 it received a RAM and SSD upgrade to extend its life. It is a workhorse and an amazing long term value. How many 2009 PCs are still running strong with the latest operating system?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We choose a 2014 Mac mini with 8Gb of RAM and a 256Gb SSD. On this computer she uses two [Viewsonic 27 inch monitors](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008A3KFB8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008A3KFB8&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenccom-20). Attached is an ergonomic mouse and a [Logitech Mac solar bluetooth keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VL8Y2C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007VL8Y2C&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenccom-20). |

At the time of purchase, I made the mistake to only included 2Gb of RAM. That decision made this Mac obsolete a year later (reminder: Always get the Max amount of RAM possible). I sold it and then saved for a new Early 2015 MacBook. It is the best laptop I've ever owned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I was able to snag it from Amazon for $149 (Normally $220). As someone who keeps up with the latest gadgets and operating systems, it was a great way to try ChromeOS. I use it regularly to browse and shop online. It boots faster than any other computer I own and is absolutely the easiest to maintain. ChromeOS has come a long way and I have a blast pushing it to its limits. For the geekier set out there, I've even installed Linux on the device to extend its usefulness.                                   |
| [Sonos Play:3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00554S24W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00554S24W&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenccom-20)                              | Sonos claims access to all the world's music. Very close, but not quite there. This device is awesome though. Easy setup over Wi-Fi and you can connect to several online accounts such as Pandora, TuneIn Radio, Google Play and other popular online sources. Even SiriusXM support is built in. It also sounds great. If you have two or more Sonos devices, you can sync the sound to provide around the home coverage of your favorite music, news or podcasts. Our Play:3 sits in our living room.                                                                                          |
| [Sonos Play:1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EWCUK1Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EWCUK1Q&linkCode=as2&tag=stevenccom-20)                              | Similar to the Play:3 above, but smaller and less expensive. Nikki has this in her home office and regularly rocks to local radio and chills to an online Beethoven channel. I anticipate that more of these will show up in our home in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

That's an exhaustive list and as I look around our home, I see other devices I need to include. I will add those as time permits. In the mean time, if you have questions about these devices, please leave them in the comments section below.
