Similar to my first [Evernote Know How blog post](http://www.stevencombs.com/evernote/2014/11/26/evernote-fullscreen-editing.html). This is a simple tip, but not immediately obvious. The task today is to simply duplicate a note. There are many reasons to duplicate a note and if you need to, I don't need to explain. So I won't.

My search to duplicate a note led me to the Mac Evernote app pull-down menu (see bonus tip at the end of the post for an Android Evernote app solution). There was no option to duplicate or copy a note. There is however an item that allows you to *Copy to Notebook…*

This option also allows you to copy within the same notebook (the task I wanted to complete). Seems obvious, and I'm embarrassed to tell you how long it took for me to figure this out. Searches online revealed many others asking the same question so I decided to document the process (and was relieved I wasn't the only one).


## Duplicate a note
Use the images and text below each to learn how to duplicate/copy an Evernote note.

Steps 1 and 2 are a simple right-click of the note you wish to duplicate (copy).

> As an alternative to the steps above, you can also select the note and then select the *Evernote* / *Note* / *Copy to Notebook…* pull-down menu option. After that, continue with steps 3 through 6 below.

In steps 3 and 4 you select the notebook to copy the note to. Evernote also provides a *Duplicate to Current Notebook* option to create a copy in the same notebook.

A copy of the original note is ready to edit and/or share.

**Bonus Android Tip:** This is also possible with the Android version of Evernote. To find the duplicate menu item, you long-click the note. This will reveal a menu that does not include a duplicate option. Tap the *See all…* menu item at the bottom. A longer menu will display and at the bottom is the *Duplicate* option. Tap and you should be able to continue from there.

Was anyone else confused before I shared this information? Please, oh please, leave a comment below. I don't want to be the only person who slapped his hand on his bald head and yelled, "Doh!"
