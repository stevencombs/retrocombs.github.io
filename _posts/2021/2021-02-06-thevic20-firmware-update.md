This blog post is a companion to the my FAST LOAD video embedded below. During the video, I upgrade my THEVIC20 to firmware version 1-5-2. This firmware update includes new features for not only [THEVIC20](https://amzn.to/3hCMY90), but also for the [THEC64 mini](https://amzn.to/38aV3P7) and [THEC64](https://amzn.to/2KO2lzJ). Watch the video to find out what's new and then read my additional thoughts below for more information.

In the video below, I demonstrate the process to update the MEGA65 (Dev Kit), core, SD card  essential files, `MEGA65.ROM`, and *M65Connect* software.

## Video Errata (as of 2021-02-06)

1. The correct reply to the the firmware update prompt is not *yes*. It is *Apply*.

## Final Thoughts

1. If you need more detailed information on how to update these devices, check out [this FAST LOAD video](https://youtu.be/05VWxCgaZBk).
2. I'd still like to know how games are selected for the carousel. The addition of PET Snake is puzzling.
3. I could not figure out how joystick port swapping works. Drop a comment if you know how to use this feature.
4. REUs! Can you say GEOS? I'd love to see if I can get this working since REU and multi-disk software now works.
