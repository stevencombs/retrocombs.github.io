Another Sunday, another ad hoc live stream.  Today I setup a new YoloBox Pro, grabbed a package that has been on my desk since October, turned on the lights and cameras, hit the "go live" button, and began my unboxing and assembly of Adabox 020. 

I did not advertise in advance because I wasn't sure I had everything working on the YoloBox Pro; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that everything worked the first time. I'll share more about the YoloBox in the [Additional Thoughts](#additional-thoughts) section, but for now, grab a drink, snacks and give the video a watch. As you'll learn, the video makes great ASMR for your office or study. Afterward, read on to find all the links mentioned and read my additional thoughts.

## Additional Thoughts

1. Must start with a thank you to Mislav for the Super Chat during the live stream. Speaking of Mislav, he asked that I cease with the ad hoc live streams and ensure I tweet in advance. I'll do my best, Mislav, but no promises! üòÑ
2. I stayed away from the details of Adabox 020. I didn't want to spoil the surprise, and I was not disappointed. LED Glasses! Not what I was expecting, but they turned out to be a lot of fun. I made a few assembly mistakes, part of the fun, but it was easy. The YouTube chat distracted me. At least that's the story I'm sticking to.
3. I'd like to spend time with Circuit Python to change the default program of the LED glasses. I hope to do that in the next month. retroCombs scrolling from eye to eye would be fun as would a holiday greeting such as *Merry Christmas*.
4. Apologies to those who logged in hoping for MEGA65 content. That is underway and I have my script/companion blog post for the next video complete. Stay tuned.
5. Speaking of, [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/stevencombs) for live stream announcements and other tweets about my retro computing journey.
6. The [YoloBox Pro](https://amzn.to/3lXNEcL) is an amazing streaming device; at least that's my analysis after a single use. I own an ATEM mini; however, I made the mistake and didn't get the streaming version. On its own, the ATEM mini switches cameras and is a good companion to OBS Studio; however, the YoloBox Pro is a step above. The device switches up to 4 cameras (3 HDMI and 1 USB), streams to a single or multiple platforms, and provides assets (lower thirds, images, scoreboard, video, and PDFs) for your video all in a portable tablet sized device. With battery power along with SIM card support, you can take the YoloBox Pro on the road.
7. For this live stream, I failed to connect the computer to share the Adafruit web pages. I have an extra HDMI port and need to connect to the Mac before the next live stream.
8. I'll use both the YoloBox Pro and OBS Studio for live streams. They each bring unique tools to the table; however, I'm eager to try the YoloBox Pro in a remote location such as work or our local maker space. I've even had ideas of throwing in my technology bag when I have overnight travel for work.
9. Finally, thanks to the handful who joined the live stream and to those of you who watched afterward.
