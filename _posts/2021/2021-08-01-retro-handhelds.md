During Amazon Prime day 2021, the lure of handheld game consoles captured my attention. I use a [RetroFlag RPi Case](https://amzn.to/2V4QlOZ) for handheld retro-gaming and enjoyed the process of assembly and configuration. You can see this process on my [Install Super RetroPie on the Retroflag GPi Case](https://www.stevencombs.com/gpicase) blog post and companion video. It's a great unit when paired with the [Super RetroPie distribution](https://mega.nz/folder/Ai5inYJa#mR2BXoPX9jnVCn42jqRjIQ).

I want to try something different; one of the many available out-of-the-box handheld retro-gaming experiences. During Amazon Prime day, these handheld units ranged in price from $10 to $50. I had affiliate funds available (thanks to my supporters!!!), threw caution to the wind, and made the decision to purchase a four of these little handheld retro-gaming devices.

In this continually updated blog post, I will share each system and include a [FAST LOAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA9RpEtS2f0&list=PLRVBh2hjFTolGfMsXnVa5rGN_f7YaL44n) companion video. Bookmark this page and come back throughout the four-part series as I work my way through these systems. It will be fun as we discover the capabilities and quirks of these handheld units.

## Introduction

I chose four different handheld game units that range in price from $10 to $50. I had ‚âà$120 of affiliate funds that became my budget for this experiment (Thanks to everyone who supports the [blog](https://www.stevencombs.com) and the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs)!). Selecting the models to purchase was difficult. Variety was a concern. There appear to be 100s of options with varying configurations. Many units are identical hardware with different seller branding.

I chose models with game counts from 380 to 4000+; similar to the options the GPi Case provides. After hours of page swapping throughout the Amazon Prime twenty-four hour period, I chose the following models to purchase and compare to the [RetroFlag GPi Case](https://amzn.to/3Au3f9A) (These are the Amazon listing titles):

1. [Great Boy Portable Handheld Games for Kids Preloaded 380 Classic Retro Games with 3.5'' Big Color Display and Gamepad Rechargeable Arcade Gaming System](https://amzn.to/3xfJQ9u)
2. [Handheld Game Console 390 Classic Games LiNKFOR Retro Mini Game Player with 3 Inch LCD Color Screen Rechargeable Battery Portable Retro Video Game Console Support for Connecting TV and Two Players](https://amzn.to/3zZoOOc)
3. [FateFan Retro Game Console with 500 Classic Games, Handheld Game Console Supporting 2 Players TV Connection, 1020 mAh Rechargeable Battery(Green)](https://amzn.to/3lgk0zK)
4. [TRIMUI Handheld Game Console with 4000+ Classical Games, Super Mini Retro Games Console Arcade, Mini Retro Gaming Player 2.0" IPS, Powkiddy Portable Video Game Console 600MA(Gray)](https://amzn.to/3zTeSW8)

üïπÔ∏è Items 1 to 3 include RCA out. If your TV doesn't support RCA out, use this [RCA to HDMI Convertor](https://amzn.to/3fjnRZ3).

## Retro Gaming Handhelds Comparison Table

Each unit has unique features and I found it difficult to compare them without a table. My table is in the embedded Google Sheet below or view directly by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18F2VdasK79-lrjHz8jJKqSnqtliHu4gak_LHxMsmsMA/edit?usp=sharing).

<iframe width="100%" height=375px src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRWTY_jl6B3ZKV_AWtv_bxFXq4vcV-znnsOuUeCL5h0zZY9eUFrIiYS9d9JIQu5H7gMS9qAONhOag5D/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

I will add to this table and when I do, I will update this blog post. This post is the landing page for my retro gaming handheld experiences. Before I open the first handheld game console, below is the unit I use to benchmark all other units.

## RetroFlag GPi Case with RPi Zero W

I purchased the RetroFlag GPi in January of 2020 at the height of COVID. It was a project to take my mind off the world. I fired up YouTube Live and shared the process with a couple of viewers (my subscriber count was ‚âà 400). Later I made an edit of the live video. You can view it below.

### RetroFlag GPi Case Companion VIDEO

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LkGX_IpcSk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p></div>

If I look back, it was this project and video that reinvigorated my interest in retro computing and gaming and look at me now! 1700+ of you find time to watch a video or two. Thank you!!!

### Unique Features

The GPi Case includes these unique features:

- Gameboy form factor and controls ‚Äì see my rant below
- Raspberry Pi Zero powered (PiZero installs in cartridge and plugs into unit) ‚Äì I'm geeky enough, I had a spare laying around
- Uses 3 AA batteries ‚Äì I use recharables
- Includes shoulder buttons ‚Äì for this newer retro games
- Supports the Super RetroBoy distribution, but you can use others ‚Äì but why would you want to and Seriously, if you know, drop a comment below
- Emulates any 1980s game system, including 8-bit computers ‚Äì including Commodore and ZX Spectrum with configuration
- IPS screen ‚Äì great views from all angels
- Holds THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of games on a single SD Card ‚Äì guarantee you can't count them all

The first unique feature is the Gameboy form factor. This is common with many handheld systems. Problem is, I am not a fan of that form factor. Since the original GameBoy, The shape of the unit and the controller placement make my hands and fingers hurt. For casual games, the layout is okay; however for action games it is a horribly frustrating and painful experience. I suspect that other systems that use this form factor will not be different. We'll find out as we look at the four units I selected.

### RetroFlag GPi Case Thoughts

As of this writing, this is the pinnacle of retro-gaming handheld gaming goodness. Not for the form factor, as I mention earlier in the article, but for the sheer number of possible emulator configurations and game system compatibility.

This is the only unit I consider a true retro gaming experience because it is the only system here that can emulate Atari, Commodore, ZX Spectrum, and other retro-computing computers from the 1980s. Other units on my 8-bit list end on our gaming timeline with the NES, and while technically those are 8-bit and worthy of their retro title, that excludes a whole inventory of amazing games. Not one of the options below emulates an Atari 2600. That's unacceptable! Notwithstanding, there is fun to be had from these devices.

Using a Raspberry Pi Zero for hardware in the GPi case is genius. As long as there are no changes to the RPi Zero's form factor, updates to the hardware in our GPi case cost ‚âà$25. No other unit on this page has that capability.

The RPi Zero emulation software receives updates to security, features, and emulators. This device is the benchmark for other handheld retro-gaming platforms even though I would prefer a [Playstation PSP](https://amzn.to/3hvF1Tu) or [Nintendo Switch](https://amzn.to/3xfkk52) form factor.

Time to compare the first unit to the RetroFlag GPi Case.

## Great Boy Portable Handheld

The first unit out of the box is the Great Boy. It was opened on 2021-07-04 as part of the original series open the box segment. The Amazon Prime Day price as $26.38 compared to the normal price of $32.98. I started with this one because is has the least number of games at 380.
