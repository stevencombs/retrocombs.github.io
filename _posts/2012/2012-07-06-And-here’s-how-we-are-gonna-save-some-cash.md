Ivy Tech will save an estimated $800,000 by purchasing OEM printer supplies and entering long-term agreements according to [Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick](http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=54526&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IIB-Headlines+%28Headlines+-+Inside+INdiana+Business+with+Gerry+Dick%29):

> “In addition to the office supplies and multi-purpose agreement with PDME, Ivy Tech has, after a highly competitive RFP process, established a multi-year agreement for premium compatible and OEM toner and ink cartridges with Indianapolis-based ICC Business Products, a family-owned small business that has been serving Indiana businesses since 1930.

The College expects to save more than 50 percent on the cost of printer toner and ink cartridges by shifting purchases from OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) toners to high quality premium compatible (remanufactured) printer toners with ICC. And through the robust RFP process, Ivy Tech was able to obtain excellent price levels for printer toners and ink cartridges.”

This one makes sense and it is good to see that the money we save will return to the state. Now if I can just convince them to outsource our email/calendaring to Google Apps for Education. I could then save them thousands!
