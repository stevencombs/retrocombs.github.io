Ever right-click on a file to choose an application to use and find multiple duplicate entries for an app (as shown in the image below)? This is a common issue for those of us who update or demo software regularly. I become a bit frustrated with it so I created this [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow to correct the issue.

This Alfred Workflow (PowerPack required) will remove those pesky duplicates quickly. The workflow simply makes it quick and easy to access a terminal shell script (see bottom of post) using Alfred. Here's how to install the workflow.

## Download:

Click the image below to download the Alfred workflow:

## Install:

* Locate the download
* Double-click the _Remove Duplicate Contextual Menu Items.alfredworkflow_ – Alfred 2 will automatically install the workflow

## Usage:

* Activate Alfred
* type `rdcmi`
* Select Remove Duplicate Contextual Menu Items from the Alfred menu - Finder will restart and an audio acknowledgement will complete the process
* Right-click a file to verify that the duplicates are removed

It was a simple process to create the workflow once the Alfred developers provided the secret sauce via a tweet to help me through a “I should have thought of that” moment.
