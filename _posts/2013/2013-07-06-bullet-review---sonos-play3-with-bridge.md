A couple of weeks ago, my wife made an offer to purchase a [Sonos Play:3][2] for me for Father's Day. I've been eyeing and researching the streaming music device for months and I believe she knew I was intent on trying one, so why not make it a gift. Good call!

At the time, [Sonos][3] was offering the [Play:3][2] with a [Sonos Bridge][4] (a $50 savings). She found the best deal on Amazon. It is now a wonderful addition to our living room (a location that will actually spread sound throughout our entire first floor). After a couple of weeks, It was time for a Bullet Review.

# The Good:
- Compact and stylish design
- Access to almost any cloud based system available ([List of services][5])
- Control apps for Mac, PC, iOS and Android to control sound and organize music/playlists with a consistent user interface across all devices
- Dead simple setup to current Wi-Fi network (you need a router with a free port)
- Necessary cables are in the box
- Sonos apps for iOS and OS X allow control from any point in home when on same network.
- Sound is excellent for a unit this size (adjust the EQ settings in the iOS or OS X app for the optimal sound quality)
- Bridge is tiny, white, and sits comfortably next to our AirPort Extreme {UPDATE May 16th, 2015 - Bride is no longer required.}
- Pairing an iOS device is simply a matter of pressing a button on the bridge
- Streaming is consistent with rarely a drop out (and those are probably due to my often spotty Comcast service)
- Queue up songs and allow others to add to the queue on different devices (great for families and parties)

# The Bad:
- No web control interface (won't work with Chromebook)
- Mono sound unless you pair another $299 device (still sounds incredible though)
- Pricey for multiple components throughout the house
- Even though vertical orientation is an option, the appearance is awkward/odd
- Limited number of Sonos favorites slots available (too many streaming options to choose from)
- No iTunes radio support

# Summary:
If my wife finds the Sonos compelling, it must be good. Right? She's really good with tech, but she was a bit hesitant about this purchase. I came home from work one day and she surprised me by saying that "the Sonos kept me motivated during work today...and it was fun!" Probably not a better endorsement than that one. I can't wait until we save up and can afford another component such as the larger [Play:5][7], [sound bar][8] or the [subwoofer][9].
