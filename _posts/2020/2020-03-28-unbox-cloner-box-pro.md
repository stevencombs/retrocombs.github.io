Time to open the box on a [Cloner Alliance Box Pro (#ad)](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd); a device that promises to be the one device to capture them all (video that is). This post is not a full review, just a few thoughts and a short eight-minute YouTube video to show what's inside the box and talk about how I plan to use the device.

## YouTube video, _OPEN THE BOX: Cloner Alliance Box Pro_

Not only do I take the Cloner Alliance Box Pro out of it's box, I also look at the product's design, features, and included cables. I even call an HDMI cable a USB cable. What fun! And because that's not the only error I make in the video, be on the lookout for pop-up corrections!

I purchased the Cloner Alliance Box Pro because I hope to do the following things with the device:

* Capture Chrome OS live to OBS Studio
* Record Chrome OS tutorials
* Capture video device menus (Roku and Android TV)
* Capture retro computer screens (Commodore 64, VIC-20, etc)

I'll run the device through its paces soon and I hope to capture my experiences in a future video and/or blog post.

> **SIDE NOTE:** I'm learning to use the free [DaVinci Resolve version 16.2](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/). Amazing video editing software and I don't know how or why it is free! There will probably more information on that side project in the future (or not; who knows).

Drop a comment below and let me know if you use a [Cloner Alliance Box Pro (#ad)](https://amzn.to/2UMUOCd). I'd love to hear from folks who use it in creative ways and with OSB Studio (if that is possible).
