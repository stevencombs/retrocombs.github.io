I've created a new OPEN THE BOX and FIRST USE video and it's a twofer! Last week I received two packages from Wyze Labs (makers of the insanely cool an inexpensive [Wyze Cams](https://amzn.to/3em85KE) and [Plugs](https://amzn.to/2wCdbS5)): A Wyze Scale and a Wyze Band. I left them in their packages until Easter weekend 2020. On Easter Day I opened them both under the camera, powered them up, and connected them to the Wyze app on my Pixel 4. How'd it go? Check out the video below to find out.

> **NOTE:** I'm still playing around with DaVinci Resolve and may have gone a bit overboard on effects and music; however, there's no better way to learn than trying out the features. Let me know if it's too much.

> **FUN FACT:** I used the [Wyze Cam with the new webcam firmware](https://www.stevencombs.com/gadgets/2020/04/05/wyzecam-to-webcam.html) to record the unboxing video on the workbench.

I've had the chance to use both the scale and the band for 24 hours. Each received a firmware update and both are working as expected; however, the Wyze Band is exceeding expectations. Listen, I know it's not an Apple Watch or an Android Wear OS device, but this thing is really handy. I've worn it for over 24 hours and during my COVID-19 day in my home office I was able to:

* view notifications from the applications I deemed most important
* be reminded of when I had to get up out of the chair and walk
* tracked my sleep the night before
* set a timer for a power nap (using Alexa)
* set an alarm for the next morning (using Alexa)
* changed the backdrop and appearance of the time (2400 format)
* checked on the weather throughout the day
* verified my step count
* measured my heart rate on the hour

All of this and my battery is still at 98%! I am very pleasantly surprised by this little activity band. With new firmware, the $30 device can only get better. I can't wait to see what Wyze has in store for future updates.

As for the scale, hey, it captures your weight, puts it in the Wyze app and keeps a log. What more should I ask of this $30 connected scale? Have an idea? Post it in the comments below.
