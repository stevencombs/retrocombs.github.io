This is the companion blog post for a quick open the box (bag) video, streamed on YouTube live, for the $25 [ORIA Precision Screwdriver Set, 86 in 1 Magnetic Repair Tool Kit with Portable Bag](https://amzn.to/3loTyBw).

## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts are always a numbered list. Here's the list for this device:

1. I'm not sure what inspired me to perform an open the box on YouTube live. It was nice to not have to worry about editing the video afterward though.
1. The velcro closure on the bag is STRONG! I feel like I'm going to tear the closure or case material when I open the bag.
2. I still wish the molded case holding the screwdriver and tips was made of stronger material. When I open the case, I feel like I'm going to crack the latch.
3. The flexible shaft is a tool I did not own. I'm sure it will come in handy.
3. The screwdrivers and tips are well made and I've already used them for several projects. Tips are durable and held in place by the strong magnet in the driver.
4. The plastic spudgers are not as solid as I hoped. I used a spudger to help me align parts on a 3D print (PLA) and the spudgers deformed. They are not ruinied, but they don't have their original sharp edges after a single use.
5. The inclusion of the anti-static wrist strap may inspire me to use it on my next electronics project. It has been years. Hmmm...maybe not.
6. How many cleaning cloths can one person have? Well, that and USB cables.
7. Not sure I understand the SIM card shells. When would I use them?
8. I'm looking forward to the first opportunity to use the suction cups and break open a mobile device.
8. Overall, I like this set and the variety to tips included. I've already had occassion to use the set and for the price, its hard to beat.

That concludes my final thoughts for this toolset. I do update and timestamp posts when modifications and additions are made, so check back later and make sure you add this site to your RSS feeds.
