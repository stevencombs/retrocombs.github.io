One of my favorite retro-computing devices of 2019 was [THEC64 mini](https://amzn.to/35lh9No). I love that it was a mini recreation of the Commodore 64 that not only looked like the original, but when plugged into an HDMI monitor, would also play Commodore 64 games built-in or on a USB drive. Upon release though, there were limitations:

1. The 64 includes some not-so-great games.
2. While you can load your own games, you couldn't have more than one on a USB drive.
3. The tiny keyboard isn't functional.
4. The UI includes a cumbersome virtual keyboard (not great for adventure games).
5. The joystick includes a few buttons to emulate keyboard controls; however, that too is a cumbersome process.

Luckily RetroBiz does include an easy firmware upgrade; and while it won't add a physical keyboard, updates can fix many of the other limitations. Before I write about the firmware upgrade process, please take a look at the retroCombs FAST LOAD (around 5 minutes) below.

## YouTube Video: _FAST LOAD: Upgrade THEC64 mini firmware (v.1.4.2)_

In the video below, I demonstrate how to upgrade the firmware on THEC64mini and demonstrate what I get for my efforts:

## Download THEVIC20/C64 Firmware 1.4.2

As of 2021-01-20, the most recent firmware has been pulled down from the Retro Games website. Several viewers and readers have asked me if I could provide. I will post here until someone tells me I need to take it down. This is done as a public service to owners of THEC64, THEVIC20, and THEC64 mini until the 2020 Christmas release is online.

## Process Overview

Now that you've seen the video, below is an overview of the steps:

> **NOTE:** The process below also works for the THEC64 (maxi) and THEVIC20.

1. Power down THEC64 mini.

2. Visit <https://retrogames.biz/support/upgrade-thec64-mini>.

3. Download the latest firmware, in this case v1.4.2, to a FAT32 formatted USB drive.

4. Plug the USB drive into THEC64 mini.

5. Power on THEC64 mini.

6. Using the Joystick, navigate to _Device Settings_ (the wrench icon).

7. Select _System information_.

8. The current THEC64 mini firmware will recognize the new firmware on the USB drive with the following:

   ```
    Firmware update found: theC64-1_4_2.bin

    Do you wish to uppgrade this firmware?

    Close                             Apply
   ```

9. Choose *Apply* and the upgrade screen (images of a USB drive, status bar, and mini) will appear. Once the upgrade is complete, THEC64 mini will reboot with the new firmware.

That's all there is to it!

## What's next?

I have another <RetroGames.biz> device on order from Amazon, [THEVIC-20](https://amzn.to/3pjwVk2). I had [THEC64](https://amzn.to/3ePEKsJ) on order and then cancelled that order when it didn't meet its availability date in the United States. The same day I cancelled the order, I found vendor on Amazon that would ship a [THEVIC-20](https://amzn.to/3pjwVk2) across the pond at a reasonable rate. My preference was Commodore VIC-20 styling since it was the first computer I owned back in 1981. I have four original VIC-20s in my basement (in various states of repair) and will compare this newer product to its older inspiration. More blog posts to come!

Anyone else enjoying [THEC64 mini](https://amzn.to/35lh9No), [maxi](https://amzn.to/3ePEKsJ), or THEVIC-20](https://amzn.to/3pjwVk2)? Let me know by leaving a comment. I would also love to read your tips and tricks for getting the most out of these little Commodore recreations.
