Hey, I get it. Folks who weren't even born in the 1970s and 80s want to review and discuss devices from the retro days of gaming and computing because those devices are just that cool; however, wouldn't it be nice to have some perspective in those reviews? How can you compare a modern version of an old classic without experiencing the classic? Sure, you can buy a retro device from a seller on eBay, but that doesn't make you an expert on the device or the original experience. Let's hear from those of us who were in our formative years when these devices were released. Let's hear from those of us who spent hours and hours understanding how influential and amazing these devices were for their time. Let's hear from those of us who are not influenced by today's technology.

And that brings me to this device; the Hyperkin RetroN 77. A modern device that is described by Hyperkin with the following "groovy" words:

> Leave your platform shoes at the door and spend the night in with the RetroN 77, the grooviest retro console from Hyperkin. It plays your favorite 2600 cartridges in beautiful, crisp 720p HD. It's one happenin' pixel party for the senses. Marvel at the slick wood paneling, save states, on-board mode select, and a 6 ft. Micro cable to power it all. You take full command with the included two-button, ambidextrous, premium controller. Original joysticks and paddles are also compatible. Can. You. Dig. It?

Gnarly! I've not played an Atari 2600 game since, well, probably the 1980s. So I'd like to see if this device can rekindle some magic and help me relive a formative time in my life. Along the way, I hope to provide readers with everything they need to know about this device. We'll look at the original experience to include the use of cartridges, all the way to modern updated firmware and homebrew games.

This post is tied to a companion YouTube video that includes visuals for this content. Each major area is tied to the time code on the video. You can use the table of contents below to jump to those areas if you have a specific interest.

## My 1970s and 80s Years

I'm an original Atari 2600 user. This wasn't my first video game system. That distinction goes to the original Pong console in the mid-1970s; however, it is the Atari 2600 I remember more fondly and as an impressionable young man of 13, this device would change my after school world.

Our family was one of the first in our community to purchase the console in 1978. We drove over an hour on a Saturday to visit a Sears department store where we purchased the Sears Video Arcade (Tele-Games) branded Atari 2600 and two games. I remember laboring with my Step Father over which two games to purchase. I choose Space Invaders, and he chose Basketball. The hour drive back was one of the longest of my life.

Once we got home with the console, I connected it to our living room television set. Even then, I was gadget geek. We gamed for hours over the weekend only taking breaks for meals and church. Before we knew it, the weekend was over and it was back to school and work on Monday. After school, I returned home to practice Basketball before my step-father returned from work. After dinner, fierce virtual NCAA games would commence.

It is important to note that Atari 2600 ownership was a pricey proposition for our middle-class family. The console coast $199 (about $800 in today's money). Cost of ownership increased as we added (or replaced) joystick controllers, paddle controllers, and the following cartridges (that I can remember):

* Adventure - The classic, move around and look for things, game
* Atlantis - An Imagic missile command clone that is far superior to even the arcade version
* Basic Programming (with Keypads) - Yes, you could actually do basic programming and the keypads could be used with other titles
* Basketball - I was the king in my home and broke many a joystick with this game.
* Boxing - I didn't like this one because I was the worst in our home and was often beaten by my Step-Father and siblings
* Chopper Command -
* Cosmic Ark -
* Demon Attack -
* Donkey Kong - An arcade port for the 2600 that didn't stink
* Haunted House - Similar to Adventure but with some scary 8-bit characters
* H.E.R.O. - A man flying with a backpack is all it took for me to want this game
* Pac Man - Everyone had this horrible version of the classic arcade game
* Pitfall - Hours, and hours, and hours jumping over crocodile heads and logs
* River Raid - Second only to Pitfall for joystick time
* Space Invaders - I believe we purchased this one with the console but I was never a fan of the arcade game so not sure why we did
* Spider Fighter - Out of control action and not for those with a fear of arachnids
* Star Master - As a Star Trek fan, I thought this would be similar (It was not!)
* Yars Revenge - Another Atari 2600 classic that was just too much fun
* Zaxxon - My favorite arcade game of all time and this port was the worst

As the console aged, many of the games in the list above came into our home at discount prices. This list should be longer; however, I've since forgotten some cartridges because they were so bad, I rarely played them. The one saving grace though is that we never did purchase the E.T. game which was so bad, they [buried all the unsold copies in a landfill](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/documentary-explores-atari-s-downfall-dumping-of-et-game-at-landfill-1.2310755).

There were some real bright spots though. Two brands stood above the rest; Imagic and Activision. Their games were far superior to Atari and I saved money from my summer mowing job and waited with baited for their cartridges. In much the same vain as owning an album with liner notes, I would select games by box art …

I continued to play the Atari 2600 through the early 1980s. The console lost favor in 1981 when I purchased my first home computer, the Commodore VIC-20. The VIC-20 took me from being a player to programming my own games. And that's a whole other story for another blog post. Suffice it to say, without the Atari 2600, I would not have continued my love of home computers.

## Enter the Hyperkin RetroN 77

I found out about the Hyperkin while doing a bit of retrocomputing research online.

## Open the Box

In the video, I share my initial thoughts as I open the box; however, here's a short summary:

1. Very impressed with the quality of the RetroN 77.
2. The power switch as a nice "kerchunck."
3. The woodgrain label is a nice throwback to the original Atari 2600 design; althought, how could would it be if actual wood was used?
4. The wood grain is also used on the included joystick. Woodgrain was not on the original, so not sure why they decided to add. I suspect over time, the label will wear and we will wish they omitted the label and left it black.
5. They joystick includes a button on both sides for your ambidextrous types.
6. There are four micro-switch buttons in the back. I understand their placement, but I kind of wish they were in the front as well. You'll see me constanty looking at the back of the unit to click the correct switch.
7. Size is just right. Not too small, not too big.
8. I love that this unit allows me to use actual 2600 cartridges as well as ROM files. 

## First Use

Using the stock firmware to begin. I will by pass the updated to the stock and go right to the community build.

During the first use, I break out an upgraded joystick with mechanical switches. Use 🕹️ You can get yours here; however, I found the joystick that came with the RetroN to be superior for playing games and was much more nostalgic.

## Community Image (Stella 6)

While Hyperion got the ball rolling, it's the community that makes this device the ultimate Atari 2600 emulator.
