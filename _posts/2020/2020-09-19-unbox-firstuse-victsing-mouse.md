My trusty 2010 Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 gave up the electronic ghost this past week. Over time, the device became less trustworthy. Is ten years the life span of an electronic rodent? Not sure, but the mouse served me well until recently when the cursor began to lag and the connection to my Mac mini would drop.

Additionally, the Microsoft notebook mouse has always been small and my goal for a new mouse was to be better fit my hand. Selecting a Logitech or another Microsoft mouse would generally be my goto options; however, like web cams during COVID-19, there's a hefty markup on premium brands. After some research, I decided to try an off-brand called [VictSing](https://www.victsing.com/) and purchase their [VictSing Wireless Mouse (#ad)](https://amzn.to/3mDnPNt).

I choose the mouse because of the features below:

* Larger form factor
* Rubberized thumb rest
* Six total buttons
* Two scroll wheels (a regular vertical scroll wheel on top and a thumb wheel for horizontal scrolling)
* Ability to pair up to three devices (two Bluetooth and one USB)
* Includes USB 2.4Ghz dongle (to allow the mouse to be used with any computer)
* 4.5 ‚≠ê reviewed on Amazon
* Under $40.

Seemed like a good deal financially and just what I was looking for with respect to hardware and features. Let's find out what's in the box, how easy it was to use, and a few final thoughts.

## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts are always a numbered list. Here's the list for this device:

1. For fun, I paired the mouse with my Pixel 4XL. It worked flawlessly and it was a hoot controlling the tiny cursor. The vertical scroll wheel worked as did the horizontal scroll wheel; although that wheel was a bit sporadic.
2. Lag on my Mac mini, as described in the video, cleared up after I removed the old Bluetooth mouse connection. It was better, but not perfect. Still some research to do to determine what is interfering with the connection. It works, just an occasional annoyance. I remove the pairing to the Mac's trackpad; however, that would take away some of my workflow. That's not a long term solution.
3. No lag on my Linux (running Elementary OS) or Chrome OS (Pixelbook and Pixel Slate) devices.
4. I enjoy the larger form-factor mouse and the rubberized thumb-rest. Mousing is more comfortable than ever before.
5. Buttons are quiet but tactile and the scroll wheels are smooth.
6. I keep forgetting about the horizontal scroll wheel and revert back to my hold habits. I will need to work this motion into my thumb's muscle memory!
7. I wish the horizontal scroll wheel was move toward the front of the me mouse about one inch. The current placement means I have to back up my thumb to scroll and feels awkward and cramped.

That's it for now. I do update and timestamp posts when modifications and additions are made, so feel free to check back later and make sure you add this site to your RSS feeds.
