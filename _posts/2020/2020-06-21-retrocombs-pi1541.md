In this supplemental episode to my [Commodore Plus/4 series](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4), I share my experiences assembling the [Pi1541 Hat](https://commodore4ever.net/collections/drives/products/pidrive-zero-raspberry-pi-hat-1541-1581-commodore-64-128-vic-20-emulator-oled-pi1541) for a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://amzn.to/2V2Je6U). In the episode, I solder a pin connector onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, solder and assemble a serial cable with two 6 pin DIN connectors, assemble the whole package, and start up the Pi1541 for a first use. For some extra fun, be on the lookout for a cameo appearance from Nikki and a former vice president!

## Random Thoughts

Assembly of the Pi1541 was easy. The hardest part was soldering the header pins on the Raspberry Pi Zero and especially those 6 PIN DIN connectors. The cable I created worked; however, it wasn't as flexible as I wished. I found cables on eBay and they arrived just in time for me to film the demonstration of the Pi1541. I'll use the cable I created for another project.

This was one of the few projects where everything worked on the first attempt. I was surprised and happy. Usually my projects end up with several hours of troubleshooting.

The user experience for this device is spot on. While I know I have some things to learn about the device, upon first use, it seems to live up to it's reputation as a "cycle-accurate" device that provides exceptional compatibility with software titles, cracks, and disk loaders. The only issues I had were with PAL software and my video capture device. I'll need to look into that one.

I mention in the video that I have plans for a Pi1541 for the Raspberry Pi Zero case. That planning is well underway and I even have a couple of prototype prints from my 3D printer. This project was a wonderful way to spend a Father's Day weekend!

I still have some things to learn about this device. I need to determine how to create a blank image on the SD card as well as format the device using the Plus/4. That's next on the workbench; how to use this device with the Plus/4.

I'm also intrigued by a similar project, the [Tapuino](http://sweetlilmre.blogspot.com/2014/07/tapuino-20-c64-tape-emulator.html). I'm currently planning to build that project and share my experience as part of this series. It's ingenious and will make a good supplemental device to the Pi1541.

That's it for this post. It's a short one but jam packed with the links you need to duplicate my project. Let me know if you have any questions using the comments below.
