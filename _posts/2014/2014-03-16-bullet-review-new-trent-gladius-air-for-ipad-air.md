In a recent [post][2] I wrote about my purchase of the [New Trent Airbender 2.0 for my iPad Air][3]. Inside the case box, I noticed a small post card with the banner, BECOME A PILOT USER. New Trent Pilot Users are beta testers that agree to review products. Pilot users have to first apply and share a past review. I shared my previous post. Much to my surprise, I was selected and had a chance to choose another product to review.

I chose the [New Trent Gladius Air][4] and you can check out my bullet review below to find out what I thought about this product. I was quite happy with previous New Trent product I actually purchased. Will I be happy with this free one?

# Pros

* Excellent shipping and packaging materials
* Protection at all critical points and openings
* Speaker and microphone openings don't impede usage
* Screen usage is not impeded at all by the screen cover
* Excellent protection
* Hand grip made from real leather
* Rotating built-in stand made from real metal, not cheap plastic
* Easy installation

# Cons

* Cost of around $45
* Adds weight to iPad (partly in thanks to the real materials used)
* Screen cover smears easily and is not as easy to clean as the glass screen
* Expect lint and dust to get caught in the corners and edge of the screen
* {UPDATE} Placing iPad face down WILL activate Siri due to home button cover

# Bottom line

I would not hesitate at all taking my iPad Air to the beach, camping, or any other natural environment when protected by the [New Trent Gladius Air][4]. This case is also perfect for manufacturing or medical environments. While I thought the [New Trent Airbender 2.0][3] afforded my iPad Air protection, it pales in comparison to this case. Recommended purchase if you need a ruggedized case.

That's two in a row for New Trent. I am becoming a huge fan of their low cost and high quality products. Check out the gallery below for pics and even more tips.
