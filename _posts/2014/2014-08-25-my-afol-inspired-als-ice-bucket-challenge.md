It happened this past weekend. I received the [ALS ice bucket](!g) challenge. Not from one individual, but from two within a 24-hour period. I knew this would happen sooner rather than later and had all but decided if the challenge was sent, I would simply [provide a donation to ALS](http://www.als.org). I know what cold water feels like and spent several hours in the glacier fed 43° waters of [Nisqually](!w) river in the late 80s as part of my Army officer’s training. I was really not interested in having a bucket of ice dumped on me so I decided to utilize my AFOL creativity and create the video below.
