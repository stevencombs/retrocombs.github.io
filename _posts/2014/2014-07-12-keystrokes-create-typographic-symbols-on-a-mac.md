I can NEVER remember the Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts that create the typographic symbols I need. Can you remember the keystroke to create a © symbol? Probably not, in which case you use the [on screen keyboard][1] method which, while useful, can really mess with your workflow.

To help me out, I created the quick reference below. It includes the typographic symbols I use most. While the chart includes some symbols readers may never use, such as the Ø symbol, I bet a few readers will find one or two.

I only include symbols I use frequently. The list is formatted as a quick reference clip-out. Simply print out this post, cut along the exterior lines and place somewhere next to your computer keyboard or monitor.

**OS X Typographic Symbol Keyboard Reference**  

**Key:  
⌥ = option  
⇧ = shift**

| Symbol | Keystroke |
| -------| ----------|
|       | ⌥ ⇧ k    |
| ®      | ⌥ r      |
| ©      | ⌥ g      |
| ™      | ⌥ 2      |
| ¢      | ⌥ 4      |
| ≠      | ⌥ +      |
| ±      | ⌥ ⇧ +    |
| ø      | ⌥ o      |
| Ø      | ⌥ ⇧ 0   |
| º      | ⌥ 0      |
| π      | ⌥ p      |
| “      | ⌥ [      |
| ”      | ⌥ ⇧ \[   |
| ‘      | ⌥ \]      |
| ’      | ⌥ ⇧ \]   |
| – <sup>(en-dash)</sup> | ⌥ \-   |
| — <sup>(em-dash)</sup> | ⌥ ⇧ \- |
  
Did I miss a commonly used symbol that I should include? Leave me a comment and let me know. It is an easy task to include it and together we can make a better reference.
