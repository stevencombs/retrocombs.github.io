The [CivicLab][1] provided our college with some excellent community engagement skills today. A quick description is below:

> CivicLab is an institute dedicated to advancing the practice of civic collaboration. Led by a team of pragmatic practitioners, CivicLab creates the tools and frameworks that form the underlying foundation for the practice of community collaboration.

This session was ripe for sketchnotes and a facilitator, who is familiar with my note taking, asked if I planned to capture notes from today’s session. I couldn’t let him down. Thanks to Amber, Jack, and John from the Civic Lab for the excellent day and sketchnote inspirations.

# Sketchnote

**Sketchnote Type** Training  
**Journal Used** [Rhodia Black Webnotebook inch Dot Grid][2] - I continue to love this journal and it is my default for all notes, not just sketchnotes.  
**Pen(s) Used** [Pilot Precise V5 RT Deco Collection][3] - You must check these pens out if you like a great writing instrument with some barrel style!
