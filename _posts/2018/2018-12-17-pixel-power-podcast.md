Some may remember that many years ago Nikki and I had a podcast centered around Adult Fans of LEGO (AFOL). After a long hiatus away from the microphone, I decided to return; but with a brand new subject: Google services and hardware. The new podcast is called the [Pixel Power Podcast][1]. You can view the logo below.

I could go into a long blog post describing the podcast, but I think the website and the [first episode][2] speak for themselves (pun intended). It is very much a work in progress and I am slowly getting comfortable behind the microphone again and tweaking the format/content.

There are three reasons I decided to jump back in the fray:

1. I enjoy researching and learning more about Google products and services so why not share.
2. I am constantly asked, "Why don't you teach us about this or that feature."
3. I was looking for a way to improve my public speaking skills and podcasting was the perfect tool.

If you have an interest in Google Pixel phones, The Google Pixelbook, Chromebooks, Google Home devices, and/or Google apps I think you will find some great tips and tricks to get the most out of these products and services. Each episode is less than 30 minutes. No guests yet, but I plan to add that feature in 2019.

I hope you will stop by and take a listen. Or you can search for Pixel Power Podcast in iTunes, Spotify, Pocket Casts or any other popular podcast client. Even if you don't listen, the episode shownote pages are loaded with links and content.

All right, I have to go now. Creating the outline for the next episode! Merry Christmas everyone.
