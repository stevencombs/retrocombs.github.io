Today a package arrived via UPS. When I opened the UPS box, the unmarked black box found in the image below was inside.

I was expecting the Amazon Echo I ordered about a month ago, but found it interesting that there were no markings whatsoever on the outside slip cover.

I had a bit of time late this afternoon and decided to take some unboxing images to see if there were any other unexpected features. I found a few and was able to get the Echo unboxed, powered up and working in a matter of minutes.

Not familiar with the Amazon Echo? Take a look at my images and be sure to read my captions to learn a bit more about this device. Without further ado…

I’ll experiment and use the Echo for a while and will probably provide some thoughts after more extensive use. As I write this, I was able to ask Alexa to play some classic rock. Echo began pumping out some Sammy Hagar deep tracks. Pretty cool and the sound is pretty good, not great, but not bad. More later…

Something you want to know about the Echo in the meantime? Leave a comment below.
