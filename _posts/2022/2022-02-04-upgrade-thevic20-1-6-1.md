TheC64 Mini, Maxi, and TheVIC20 received a new firmware version, 1.6.1 to start the new year. During a lengthy Sunday afternoon live stream, I updated both my TheC64 Mini and my TheVIC20 to see what was new. I opened the live stream with a "Vicky Twenty" motherboard unboxing. I‚Äôll share more on this VIC-20 upgrade later in this post.

Before you read the rest of this post, look at my companion video below that compacts a one hour and fifty minute live stream to a mere twenty-minute shadow of its self but includes all the information you need to upgrade your TheC64 or VIC20. Read below to learn how you can view the entire live stream.

## Vickey Twenty

As shared in the video, I have [four untested VIC-20s](https://www.stevencombs.com/vic20-ebay-purchase) with one "kinda" working. This will be a large project as I attempt to take the three non-working, the Vicky Twenty motherboard, a lot of de-soldering and soldering, to create another working unit. In the live stream, we chat about retro-brighting. Have an opinion? Drop it in the comments below.

For this project, I need to plan, purchase additional components and sockets, [get a de-solderer](https://amzn.to/3ulwQBk), and a lot of time. I might live stream part of the process but will document it in either a blog post or video. I hope to have my new [Portable Oscilloscope Multimeter - Pokit Pro](https://www.pokitinnovations.com/pokit-pro/) on hand that's been on a long journey to my workbench.

## TheC64 Firmware Upgrade Live Stream

This video above is an edit of a much longer live stream. If you'd like to watch the entire live stream, check out this post:

<https://www.buymeacoffee.com/retroCombs/e/54752>

Members can watch for free and non-members can watch for a buck!

It's one hour and fifty minutes of fun with great chat/interaction from viewers. In the lengthened version, you can watch the upgrades of the TheC64 mini and TheVIC20 from start to finish, including more system configuration and game play demos. Included, I talk more about my plans with the Vicky Twenty and my lot of 4 VIC-20s purchase.

Producer Jamie, shared this link to Space Lords, <[Space Lords by RGCD.DEV](https://rgcddev.itch.io/space-lords)>. If you don't own a TheC64/VIC20 you can purchase a boxed cartridge version or download a copy for VICE or to run on an SD2IEC device.
