Here's a tip that will let you access symbols quickly – even obscure ones. It involves using the Mac OS X on-screen keyboard and _Characters_ window. Here's how to access these tools in OS X Snow Leopard:

* Load _System Preferences_
* Select _Keyboard_
* Click the _Show Keyboard Character & Viewer in menu bar_ box as highlighted in the image below

* Close _Preferences _\- a keyboard menu bar item will be displayed as shown in the image below

* Click the _Show Character Viewer_ in the menu bar item to display the _Characters_ window as shown below

The _Characters_ window provides access to every symbol available. If you need arrows, math symbols, music notes or any other obscure symbol, this is the place to begin looking. If you just need access to standard symbols, try using the on screen keyboard to quickly located them following the steps below.

* Click the _Show Keyboard Viewer _ in the menu bar item to display the on screen keyboard as shown in the images below

As noted in the images, if you hold down the _Option_ key (⌥), or the _Option_ \+ _Shift_ key (⌥+⇧), the keyboard will change to display the characters available using normal keyboard shortcuts.

Enjoy having access to every symbol conceivable for your documents.
