Here's a quick, yet very handy, tip when that pesky Apple Remote activates Front Row (for old school Macs) or other apps on your Mac while controlling your Apple TV.

* Choose Apple Menu / System Preferences...
* Choose Personal / Security
* Select the Disable remote control infrared receiver checkbox as shown below

![Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver][1]

* Close System Preferences

That's it! Short and simple fix.
