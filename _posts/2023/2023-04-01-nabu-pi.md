I don't want to tether my NABU Personal Computer to my Mac using the RSS-422 serial connector. I'd like to be able to place the NABU anywhere in the room. To facilitate this, I decided to grab a Raspberry Pi 3 and whip up a headless Wi-Fi/SSH configuration to serve up the NABU Internet Adapter software.

## Setup the Raspberry Pi

1. Download the Raspberry Pi Imager (brew install raspberry-pi-imager)
2. Insert SD card into the PC
2. Select the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-Bit) image
3. Select the SD Card
3. Modify image configuration (Wi-Fi, SSH, etc)
	4. Hostname: nabu-pi.local
	5. Login: nabu
	6. Password: v****333
3. Burn the SD card
4. Remove SD card from PC
5. Insert SD card into the Raspberry Pi
6. Plug in the Raspberry Pi power adapter
4. SSH from a PC to the Raspberry Pi with `ssh nabu@nabu-pi.local`
5. `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`
6. `sudo raspi-config`
4. Enable the serial adapter (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/enabling-serial-console) with 3 - Interface Options / I6 - Serial Port / Finish
5. `wget https://cloud.nabu.ca/linux-arm.zip`
6. `unzip linux-arm.zip`
7. `rm linux-arm.zip`
8. Rename the folder using `mv linux-arm nabu-ia`
9. `ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 libdl.so` is a SYM Link required to keep Raspian from crashing
9. `chmod +x ./NABU-Internet-Adapter-84`
10. `./nabu-ia/NABU-Internet-Adapter-84`

If the application is working, its now time to connect the Raspberry Pi to the NABU.
