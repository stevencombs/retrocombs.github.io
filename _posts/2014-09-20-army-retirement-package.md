After a three year period, I FINALLY received my United States Army retirement materials. When I left the Army in August of 2011, there was no fanfare, ceremony or recognition from my unit. Honestly, it was a huge letdown after 27 years of military service in both the United States Air Force as an enlisted airman and the United States Army as an Armor and Adjutant General officer. Despite the lack of recognition from my unit, I did think the Army would eventually send me my retirement certificate. It did not happen. 

Several weeks ago, I noticed that my unit’s major command was promoting their [Facebook page for retirees](https://www.facebook.com/88thRSO). I decided to drop them a message about my disappointment and lack of materials. A response was almost instantaneous. My request was quickly researched and an apology sent. Within two weeks, a box was on my doorstep. It arrived on a bright Saturday morning. I was elated as I held a warm cup of coffee in one hand and reached down to grab the package with my other. It was like Christmas morning.

I’ve conducted several unboxing of gadgets, but today I present the most important unboxing yet. The unboxing of my United States Army retiree package!

# The box
I love the box and the title:

> Celebrating Your Legacy of Service…

This is not a cheesy, nor cheap box and is an item that needs to be displayed. I’ll have to give that some thought.

# Box side panels with army values
Army values play an important part of an Army officer’s career. Having them emblazoned on the box is a nice reminder that they are still appropriate in [my civilian career](http://www.stevencombs.com/higher-education/2014/09/20/campus-president.html) and in life.

# A document
Inside appears to be a letter.

# The letter
The included letter describes the contents (spoiler alert!) and serves as a letter of gratitude for my service.

# My certificate of appreciation from the POTUS
That’s my certificate from the president of the United States (POTUS) and our commander in chief.

# Certificate of retirement 
This is the most important document in the box and is from the United States Army chief of staff.

# Certificate of appreciation for spouse
Outstanding! This is the second most important document in the box and goes to my wonderful wife, Nikki. She was incredibly supportive of my career and deserves so much more than this document; however, it is a nice touch. Must get this framed for her office.

# Removing the documents reveals…
On the top-left is a DVD. In the center is a lapel pin. On top-right is an Army Retired sticker. At the bottom is a United States flag. Not sure, but wonder if this is the flag that will be draped on my coffin for my military funeral?

# DVD
Let’s see what’s on the DVD.

## Video from DVD
I ripped the DVD and uploaded it to YouTube so you can view. It’s a great video that demonstrates the impact the Army has on the lives of its soldiers.

# Lapel pin
I have another one of these I purchased at [AAFES](http://www.shopmyexchange.com/). Might make this one part of a hanging display along with the backing ribbon.

# One last image of the box lid
All I have to say here is:

> #Hooah!

How true that statement is. I WILL ALWAYS BE A SOLDIER!

While the wait was three years, I have to say, it was worth the wait. Time to get these certificates framed and up on my wall at the office. It has been a great day of reflection on my military career.
