It's time for another Wyze product OPEN THE BOX and FIRST USE. This time, it's the Wyze Headphones. As an early backer, I received a pair faster than most; however, you can now purchase your own pair and according to Wyze, they should arrive before the holidays. In this video, I open the box (unbox) and show you my experience turning them on for the first time. I also pair them with the Wyze app and see what features the app brings to this pair of headphones. Check out the video below.

## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts are often a numbered list. Here's the list for the Wyze Headphones:

1. I've used the headphones more sense my FIRST USE video. Still not sure about all-day comfort. I've yet to find any headphones I want to wear all day, so that's probably just me. [**UPDATE:** The headphones are more comfortable than I first thought. I noticed after about an hour that I didn't even notice them on my head. Just the sweet tunes of Earth, Wind, and Fire in my ear!]
2. The firmware update was unusually long and I did have my phone sitting next to the headphones. I'm hopeful the firmware update took care of any protracted future firmware updates.
3. The Wyze app works well to control headphone audio profiles; however, I will not use the app to turn noise cancellation on and off. The physical button the headphones is more convenient as is the hand over the right headphone.
4. Place a hand over the right earphone to allow ambient noise for conversations, or just to wonder if you are missing anything, is brilliant. I approve!
5. Speaking of headphone and audio controls, they are tiny. The noise cancellation button is the perfect size; however, the audio control and power buttons are too small.
6. As I suspected, I did turn off the headphones by accident while trying to change the volume. Off should not be a tap of the power button, but a long tap. Again, maybe a future firmware update will correct this issues.
7. The headphones sound great. I like the sound and for $50, I'm not sure you will find a set of headphones that sound as good as these with all the features included such as app support and noise cancellation.
8. I believe that I can get 20 hours of battery life out of these things. It's been great so far!
9. I mention in the video that I believe both headphones have touch sensitive controls. I sit corrected. Looks like the right headphone is the only one with gesture control.
10. Noise cancellation is amazing! The best of any pair of headphones I've used with this technology.
11. I don't think you will find pair of headphones as this price point with this quality or number of features. I recommend.

That's it for now. I do update and timestamp posts as I receive questions and post updates. Check back later and make sure you add this site to your RSS feeds.
