It's time for another Wyze product OPEN THE BOX and FIRST USE. This time, it's the Wyze Cam version 3 or Wyze Cam V3. In this video, I open the box (unbox), make all hardware connections, pair a camera to the Wyze app, share examples of image captures, and then compare these images with Wyze Cam version 2 (Wyze Cam V3 -vs- Wyze Cam v2). Check out the video below.

## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts are often a numbered list. Here's the list for the Wyze Cam V3s:

1. I didn't include sample video in my YouTube segment. In hindsight, that would have been nice; however, I've found that the results are very similar to the still shots I share. Just pretend they move and you have an example of video!
2. I do like the extra long cable that comes with the version 3s. I have a location outside, to keep on eye on packages, and the extra long cable (6 feet) is perfect!
3. While the connection between the camera and the 6 foot long cable seems water tight, I'm not so sure about the other end that connects to the power adapter. That's a standard USB 2.0 plug. That's a miss and I'll probably seal that up with some caulking.
4. I've been impressed with camera quality. The more I use it, the more I see the difference between the version 2s and the version 3s.
5. I highly recommend everyone throw a [micro SD](https://amzn.to/3qAm1qM) card into these cameras. While the Wyze service is inexpensive, comparatively, if you just want to capture video, SD cards are cheap enough to make these inexpensive cameras even more useful for things like [squirrels cams](https://youtu.be/iMRspt-YkDw).
6. I continue to be amazed at the price per performance of Wyze products and version 3 of the Wyze Cams lives up to the hype. I'd love to replace every version 2 in the home, but there are just too many!
7. When will see a version 3 of the Wyze Pan and Scan? I have several of those waiting for replacement!

That's all for now. I do update and timestamp posts as I receive questions. Check back later and make sure you add this site to your [RSS feeds](/rss).
