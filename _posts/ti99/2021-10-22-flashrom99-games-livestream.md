After receiving and then creating a [video/blog post](https://www.stevencombs.com/flashrom99) about the FlashROM99 from [The Brewing Academy](https://thebrewingacademy.com), I went online to show how to play games from the device and experience, for the first time, these Texas Instruments TI-99/4A versions of popular 1980s video games.

> **MEMBERSHIP:** I now offer retroCombs memberships from $1 (PET level membership) to $20 (MEGA65 level membership) that include levels in between for all budgets (VIC-20, C64, Plus/4, and C128). If you'd like to support my content and get access to my Discord server along with other cool freebies, check out each level at <https://www.buymeacoffee.com/retroCombs>.

Before you read the rest of this post, look at my companion video below and then continue reading to learn more about the FlashROM99 and watch me reminisce with video games from the 1980s.

## Video Errata

Jamie informed me that when playing Burger Time, you don't throw salt, but pepper, as shown on the screen!

## Additional Thoughts

1. If you want more information about the FlashROM99, including instructions to prepare and use the device, check out [my previous post](https://www.stevencombs.com/flashrom99).
2. Since my collection of Texas Instruments TI-99/4A related content is growing, I've created a [TI-99/4A resource page](https://www.stevencombs.com/ti994a) to highlight that content and share my journey with this recent addition to my retro computing collection.
3. Two stalwarts joined me for this livestream (with about 6 more popping in and out):

   - https://twitter.com/KrlezaMislav - A tremendous shout out for sending a Super Chat during the livestream. One of my biggest supporters and "virtual" friends. Thanks for continuing to support the channel and for being a part of the community.
   - [Jamie](https://twitter.com/slofunk) - From the [Jamie's Hack Shack YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-otrG2r_FluXkR8lUYWdPg), and neighbor, mentioned his [Extralife4kids](https://www.extra-life.org) November 6th, 2021 event. If you'd like to sponsor and support the Children's Hospital in Louisville, KY, use this link, <https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=458561>. As the father of a child who has spent many hours in this hospital, I can vouch that they will put the funds to good use.

4. I used the [Blackmagic ATEM Mini](https://amzn.to/3iN4r0p) for the first time during this livestream. I have much to learn about this powerful switching device and there's a bunch of features packed in, via the Mac application, that I've yet to explore. I made a mistake and should have purchased the [ATEM Mini Pro](https://amzn.to/3avLFG5) for $100 more or the [Pro ISO](https://amzn.to/3oPdIJk) for $400 more. Each includes streaming directly from the box and recording. I've listed the ISO as a Buy Me A Coffee goal. If I reach $1000, I'll upgrade. If you want to help reach that goal, click the Buy Me A Coffee icon on the lower-right of this page.
