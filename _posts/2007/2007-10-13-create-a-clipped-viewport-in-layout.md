I created the video below (several years ago in fact) to demonstrate how to create a clipped viewport in LayOut, the companion layout software for SketchUp Pro. The clipped viewport option allows you to create an other than rectangular shaped viewport. In my video, I show you how to create a circular viewport to highlight a specific feature on a model.

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">
  <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FQFOg4rIxo?list=PLA1A7B445DEC1533B" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p>
</div>

I hope that helps someone as I found it a bit tricky and not at all intuitive; however, when you learn how to use this feature, you can create some amazing layouts for your models ready for print or electronic distribution.
