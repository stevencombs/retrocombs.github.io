Here's a quick tip for those who may be battling the "previous recipients issue" in Apple Mail. For those not familiar with the issue, let me give you a quick example.

> You compose a message in Apple Mail and send it to a recipient. You then later find that the recipient prefers future messages sent to a different email address. When you compose your next message to the recipient, the old address appears as you start to address the new email. You enter the new address; however, the third and subsequent times you compose a message to the recipient, autocomplete shows both addresses. If you are not careful, you will repeat your original error and select the non-preferred address. How do you get rid of the old address?

You can remove an address from the Apple Mail previous recipients list with the following steps:

* From the Apple Mail pull-down menu, chose *Window* / *Previous Recipients* - Apple Mail will display the *Previous Recipients* window shown in the image below.

* Manually scroll to find the offending address, or better yet, use the search input box to quickly locate the address
* Click on an email address to highlight
* Click the *Remove From List* button to eradicate the email address from the previous recipients list
* Close the *Previous Recipients* window

When you create a new email message (âŒ˜ + n) and begin to enter an email address, the incorrect recipient's email address should no longer appear.

This is an easy fixes; however, it was very bothersome and it took me awhile to find the solution. Now the solution will be just a Google search away for some else struggling with the same issue.
