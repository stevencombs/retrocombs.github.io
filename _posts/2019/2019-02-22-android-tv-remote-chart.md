In [episode 0012][EP-0012] of my podcast, [Pixel Power Podcast][PPP], I share my experiences with several Android TV remotes. While preparing for the episode, I created a [Google Sheet](https://sheets.google.com) to compare the features of each remote I tried. When I completed the sheet I thought, "this might be useful for others." After completing the comparison sheet, I provided a link in the [show notes][SN-0012].

During the episode, I asked listeners to contribute to the sheet. If you are reading this and you use an Android TV box (I use the [nVidia Shield TV][nVidia]) with a third-party remote that is not listed, please send me the information, and I'll add it.

You can send this information via email to: <steven@pixelpowerpodcast.com>

I hope Android TV users find this chart useful. If you do, drop me a comment below. I'm also open to suggestions for additional information I should include.
