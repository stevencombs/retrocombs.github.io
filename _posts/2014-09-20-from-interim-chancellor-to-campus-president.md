One of the things about a promotion, is the promotion! As is evident in the content below, on September 19, 2014 I was appointed as the [Ivy Tech Community College – Columbus](http://www.ivytech.edu/columbus) campus president. A press release, found at the bottom of this page, was submitted that same day and it didn't take long for the news to spread. Admittedly, I also helped spread the news on my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/steven.b.combs/posts/10152716178628839), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stevencombs/), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/118020098182159765872/posts/Sr7swpUDz31) pages. There was an outpouring of congratulations from friends, family, colleagues and community leaders. I can’t thank them enough for their support and confidence.

I've served as the interim chancellor, for the old Columbus/Franklin region, for the past seven months. As the college reorganized, they were in need of a campus president to continue to engage the community, ensure efficient campus operations and serve as the chief customer service officer. As the vice chancellor for academic affairs, these were not an expectation; however, during the past seven months, I began to enjoy these aspects of my interim chancellor role. I am glad to have the opportunity to continue this work in the newly created campus president's position and to serve our newly appointed regional chancellor.

More exciting is that I will not only serve the city of Columbus, but I also have responsibility for the communities of Scottsburg, North Vernon, Seymour, Greensburg and Nashville. In my interim role, I began to learn much about each of these unique communities. Each comes with differing cultures, challenges and opportunities and it is these unique community qualities that excite me. Since becoming a dean at our Lafayette campus four years ago, I have enjoyed bringing teams together and to work with community leaders to expand educational opportunities. I am pleased and humbled that the college has selected me to continue this work.

Now it is time for the shameless self promotion. Below are the articles that appear in newspapers or are online. As I discover additional content, I will add them below. I am sure the majority of you will not be interested in these and this will simply serve as my “scrapbook.”
