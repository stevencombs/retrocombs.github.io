I've been a writer most of my adult life. In the mid and late 1990s, my focus was on  non-fiction. During the 90s, I used the ubiquitous Microsoft Word and Aldus Pagemaker for my writing. Now, I use Ulysses (for macOS and iOS) and Markdown (not software, but a markup language for quick and distraction free writing) for large writing projects.

You can see a list of books I've authored on my Amazon Author's page at:

As I work with new writing tools, and as I begin my foray into fiction, this page will consolidate posts related to my experiences.
