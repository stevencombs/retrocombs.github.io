This is my resource page for the Pi1541. This page contains general information about the device as well as tips, tricks, and usage.

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key  | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:---- |:------------- |:---- |:----------- |
| `⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `⌫`  | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `⇧`  | Shift         | `␣`  | Space       |

## Links to Episodes

Below is a link to each blog post in the series. Each blog post contains the companion YouTube video and most include links to items or sites. This page captures a collection of all links mentioned.

1. [Pi1541 Assembly and First Use'](/pi1541-1)

    In the episode, I solder a pin connector onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, solder and assemble a serial cable with two 6 pin DIN connectors, assemble the whole package, and start up the Pi1541 for a first use. For some extra fun, be on the lookout for a cameo appearance from Nikki and a former vice president!

2. [Create a blank .c64 disk image for the Pi1541 or SD2IEC](/pi1541-2)

    The Pi1541 turned out to be a great device; if you have a bunch of disk images laying around your computer. As I began to prepare for my next [using the Commodore Plus/4 episode](/plus4), it became evident that I needed a blank disk image so I could save and load my own basic program and application files. I wasn’t sure you could do this with the Pi1541 by itself, so I began to look for hints online. Turns out, you cannot. You need to do this on a computer using some software. In this post and the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/giOADYxKkgc), I share that process as well as some other tips.
