The career that finances my hobbies is that of a higher education administrator for a community college in Indiana. I occasionally share experiences or thoughts about my career in higher education whether it be academics, logistics or administration.

Below are my higher education related posts:

<ul id="blog-posts" class="posts">
{% for post in site.categories.higher-education %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }} &raquo; </span><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
