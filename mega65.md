Followers know I own one of 100 [MEGA65 Dev Kits (#261)](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-1) to closely follow and enjoy the development of the [MEGA65](https://www.mega65.org). That ownership allows me to experience, once again, my love of Commodore computers and the joy of BASIC and 8-bit computers. Was it a pricey purchase? For Sure. Was it worth it? Every penny!

I use my Dev Kit not in true developer fashion, but as a user and to help spread the word of why every Commodore retro-computing fan needs to start saving their pennies and selfishly, to have a great time learning about this computer that "could have been."
