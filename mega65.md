I own one of 100 [MEGA65 Dev Kits (#261)](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-1) and one of the first batch of 400. This ownership allows me to experience, once again, my love of Commodore computers and the joy of BASIC and 8-bit computers.

## My MEGA65 BASIC Programs

The memories of programming my VIC-20 and C128 are alive as I use BASIC 65 on the MEGA65 and create my own programs. Use the link below to view my BASIC programs:

* [Submarine Tracking Program](https://files.mega65.org?id=b3301095-87cf-4c9e-b954-b2922b7ee270) - This program is a recreation of the [submarine tracking program](https://www.stevencombs.com/basic65-sub-track-update) found in the Commodore 128 Programmer's Reference Guide.
