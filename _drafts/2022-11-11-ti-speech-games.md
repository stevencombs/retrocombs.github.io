## The Games

I chose the following games thanks to the [Games using the TI Speech Synthesizer | BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/277867/games-using-ti-speech-synthesizer) page:

1. Demon Attack (Non Speech)
2. Parsec
3. Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator
4. Alpiner
5. Microsurgeon
6. Super Astrosmash *
7. Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom
8. Fathom
9. M*A*S*H
10. Meteor Belt *
11. Space Bandits *
12. Wing War *

I was unable to find a definitive site, so this one did in a pinch. Once I identified the games to play, I moved a copy of them into their own director on the FinalGROM99 SD card.
