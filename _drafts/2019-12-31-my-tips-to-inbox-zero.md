I "brag" to family, friends, and colleagues when I reach inbox zero. I do this to inspire others to share in my joy of having a tamed inbox. Unfortunately, my boasting is not helpful. I just tell people my inbox is empty, but have never shared the process; until now. Let's get started. I include a table of contents in case you want to jump around this post to specific steps.

Let's get started on the eight steps I use to reach inbox zero:

## Step 1: Unsubscribe to EVERYTHING

The first step is to remove the noise from your inbox. Do you really need email arriving from stores you rarely shop and, should you really be getting them delivered to your work account? Do you really need to know when the next conference is for an organization you stopped paying dues to years ago? And what about those daily political messages? Nope, you don't need those either. Time to unsubscribe to EVERY email list you are on except those you reguarly act on. Notice I said act on, not read. What does that mean? Unless you would set an appointment, reply, or "actively read (not review and delete)" the email, remove your address from their bulk list.

Look in the email for an unsuscribe link; most of the time these links are at the bottom of the message so you can't easily fnd them (like the one shown below).

![Unsubscribe link](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/email-unsubscribe-link.png)

For reputable organizations, these links do work. If you aren't sure about the organization's validity or can't find a link to unsubscribe, use your email client's tools to spam the message. Gmail provides an unsubscribe and spam tools such as the ones shown below:

1. Click the *Unsubscribe* link. ![Unsubscribe link](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-link.png)
2. Click the *Unsubscribe* button to verify.![Unsubscribe button](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-dialog.png)
3. Next choose the option to move the original email to the Spam folder to report all future messages as spam in the even that unsubscribe does not work. ![Move to Spam](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/gmail-unsubscribe-report-spam.png)

These tools work well. Unfortunately, I only have my personal account in Gmail. For work, I am stuck with Outlook which only includes a report as spam option as shown below:

![Outlook Junk Menu](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/posts/2019-12-01-steps-to-inbox-zero/outlook-junk-menu.png)

## Step 2: Delete, delete, and delete

Begin by deleting everything in your inbox older than 18 months (24 at the most).

Even if you do need the email info at a later date, you can rest assured that there's another non inbox zero user who has the original message! Don't feel ashamed to ask. The bragging you get to do about inbox zero is far greater than the embarrasement of asking someone for a past message.

Email rules can automate the removal of messages. For instance, I do not need to know when everyone responds to an invite to attend a meeting, that's what the meeting invite is for, so I use rules to automatically delete these responses. I also have a rule that deletes forwards of forwards since those are almost always chain emails.

## Step 3: Schedule time to inbox zero

After you prune and automate your inbox, you will use steps four through six daily to tidy up your inbox. Before you start these steps, block out a couple of hours to a half day to complete your first triage session (depending on the number of message in your inbox).

## Step 4: Daily triage

You receive messages daily. The best case scenario is for you to review all messages at once, on a computer, at a specific time, during the day; however, depending on your role within an organization, this may not be an option. In this case, use your mobile phone to triage your email throughout the day. I define triage as:

1. Delete messages that have no value (you know the ones).
2. Mark messages as spam and unsubscribe.
3. Respond to messeages when they only require a one or two line response. If a longer response is needed, use your computer with a full-size keyboard because you are wasting time if you type and edit a reply on your mobile device.

> **OPTIONAL:** Use the voice typing features on your phone. I recommend [Gboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en_US) for both iOS and Android.

## Step 5: Make time for longer replies

If an email requires significant time to respond, switch to your calendar and schedule time. As a rule, if an answer requires more than one paragraph or research, I will not try to reply on my mobile device. I know me and this would just make me frustrated. And who needs more frustration in their life?

## Step 6: Create your personal information library

The most common comment I hear from naysayer colleagues is, "I can't move to inbox zero because I might those emails." Come on, folks! No email client was ever designed to archive information. What would happen if we left snail mail in our mailbox? The post office would stop delivering and if you are not careful, the same thing will happen with your email. And who wants to try and search through piles of email?

I see it all the time; people scrolling and scrolling to find a message they need. Instead of scrolling, try using the search tool built-in to the email client. Second, don't be amazed when that search tool lets you down. This was the single flaw in the system that caused me to create a text-based archival system.

So what's my system for email archival? I archive messages in folders on my computer in plain text files (technically, I use Markdown files but that's for another post). I simply copy the informatin I need from the email message and then paste it into a text file.

### Rational to use text files

Why a text file to save information? Below are the five reasons I think you should use text files when archiving information:

1. Text files are always accessible. If you have text files from the late 1980s, you can still open and edit them because they are not in some proprietary format that has changed or is no longer supported.
2. Because text files are not in some wacky format, they can be opened by any word processor if you need to repurpose the text for another document.
3. Plain text is easy to copy and paste (an email for instance). I prefer to prewrite long emails in a text editor so I don't accidently send them before they are complete or gone through a second editing process. Since they are stored as a file, I can later reuse that content.
4. Text files are quickly searched using the built-in tools of most operating systems. On a Mac, activate Spotlight. On Windows, tap the Windows key. On Chrome OS, press the search key. On Linux, refer to your distro for the proper file search tool.
5. A good text editor provides tools that even full-featured word processors don't have such as multiple cursors (see example below), language recognition, advanced line sorting, search across multiple files, and additional plugins to add text based superpowers.

### Choosing the correct editor

Choosing an editor is a matter of personal preference. I think I've tried everyone for Linux, Mac and Chrome OS. My personal preference is Atom. In fact, this blog posted was created and posted from Atom. [Atom](https://www.atom.io) is available for all computers but comes with a bit of a learning curve; however, for basic text, it works perfectly and allows you to collect not just single files but entire directories. Below is a sample of one of my text file directories.

> Don't want to set up folder on a computer but want access to all this text file goodness? Give [Simple Note](https://simplenote.com/) (Window, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web) a try. It's free, includes search, syncs across all devices, and if you ever do need your data as plain text, you can export everynote.
![A folder full to Markdown files](/images/posts/2019-12-24-inbox-zero/folder-of-text-files.png)

Because I can load a directory of files within Atom, I can search for words in all of those files using Atom's multiple and advanced search tools. A discussion on Atom and its features is for another post; however, if you really want to give my inbox zero a try, I recommend you start with this free application.

If you just want to give the basic concept of storing files as text files, try the text editor built-in to your operating system. Most have one; Windows has Notepad, Mac's have Text Editor, and Linux has whichever is the preferred for the distribution. Chrome OS doesn't come with an installed text editor, but download the free [Caret](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en).

> Some of you may use Evernote to store your notes. I do not recommend this app. First, Evernote does not store files as plain text and this makes it hard to export your data. Second, Evernote limits the number of devices you can sync with using a free account. Third, I like free options and Evernote's current subscription model is not my cup of tea.

### File names matter

I use the format YYYY-MM-DD at the BEGINNING of almost every file I create or copy to my computer. I follow this date with a descriptive file name using Title Case. Here's an example:

`2019-12-21 My Tips to Inbox Zero.md`

Using this file format, I can:

- view the original creation or reference date of the file. Remember, if you modify a file, the date of the file changes. Most operating systems (OS) maintain a creation date, but not all share that information by default
- sort files by name in chronological or reverse chronological order
- search for a file's timeframe when I can't remember the name of the file
- search `2019-10` to reveal all files created in the month of October in the year 2019
- use my computer's automation tools to delete files when they reach an expiration date (for instance, delete any file over two years old.)

### Where to store the files

You could store files in a folder on your desktop or laptop; however, if you want to have access to these files anywhere, you need to place them in a file that syncs across devices. Doing so will make this system really shine!

Imagine being on the go and someone asks you a question about information you  stored in one of these text files. Because you have the files in a folder synced across devices, you can use a mobile device's browse or search tools to quickly retrieve the information.

If you want this type of access, don't just save them to a folder on your desktop or laptop. Save the files to Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox folder and then sync that folder across all your devices.

### Attachments

If your inbox is like mine, it is full of email messages with attachments. Some of these you may need to refer to at a later date. Here's what I do with these documents:

- Download the attachments to a folder (a flat folder is fine, but you can organize by topic if you like)
- Name the file using date format outlined above

Like the text files, you can now search these attachments by date. Since you are adding the date at the beginning of the file, now when you search for a specific date, not only will the text file appear, but also the associated attachment.

### PDF files

If this whole text file and attachment things seems a bit complicated (its really not), you can export email as PDF files. Most operating systems now have an option to print to a PDF file and will perform optical character recognition on the file so you can search for the contents of the documents. Again, start the name of the file with a date.

## Step 7: Create a routine

Schedule a couple of hours every week on your calendar to reach inbox zero. I try and do this twice a week (and admittedly am not always successful, but never have over 50 messages in my inbox at one time).

## Step 8: Celebrate

Now that you have your inbox clean (and that won't last long). Take time to celebrate (i.e. BRAG!). Do this on social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn with `#inboxzero`. Be the envy of your peers.

Collagues at work know of my love to celebrate my status of Inbox Zero and gave me this shirt for Christmas 2019.

You better bet I'm going to wear it!

## Conclusion

So that's my system and my suggestions for modifications; however, I know this system will not be everyone's cup of tea but hopefully it gets the gears turning in your head. What, if any, of these steps can help you achieve the sanity that is #inboxzero?
