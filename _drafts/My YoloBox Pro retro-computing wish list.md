How I use the YoloBox Pro

Live Streams

1. My Set Up
2. Connecting Retro Computers (Cloner Alliance and Adapter)

My YoloBox Pro retro-computing wish list

1. Default value for display of chats
2. Network (SMB) access to the SD Card to move content on and off without ejecting the SD card
3. Add custom fonts - I need a good 8-bit font
4. Audio Sync with HDMI (currently an echo and that makes it very difficult to speak)
5. Upscaler (unusual size video, especially with the MEGA65)
