In [my last handheld gaming console post](https://www.stevencombs.com/linkfor), I continue to describe my Amazon Prime day 2021 experience and the purchase of four retro handheld gaming consoles. The second handheld was the [LiNKFOR handheld gaming console](https://amzn.to/3zZoOOc).

As a reminder, I chose four different handheld game units that range in price from $10 to $50. I had ‚âà$120 of affiliate funds that became my budget for this experiment (Thanks to everyone who supports the [blog](https://www.stevencombs.com) and the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs)!). These include:

1. [Great Boy Portable Handheld Games for Kids Preloaded 380 Classic Retro Games with 3.5'' Big Color Display and Gamepad Rechargeable Arcade Gaming System](https://amzn.to/3xfJQ9u)
2. [Handheld Game Console 390 Classic Games LiNKFOR Retro Mini Game Player with 3 Inch LCD Color Screen Rechargeable Battery Portable Retro Video Game Console Support for Connecting TV and Two Players](https://amzn.to/3zZoOOc)
3. [FateFan Retro Game Console with 500 Classic Games, Handheld Game Console Supporting 2 Players TV Connection, 1020 mAh Rechargeable Battery(Green)](https://amzn.to/3lgk0zK)
4. [TRIMUI Handheld Game Console with 4000+ Classical Games, Super Mini Retro Games Console Arcade, Mini Retro Gaming Player 2.0" IPS, Powkiddy Portable Video Game Console 600MA(Gray)](https://amzn.to/3zTeSW8)

üïπÔ∏è Want to extend your gameplay for items 1 through 4? Purchase additional [BL-5C 3.7V 1020mAh Rechargeable Batteries](https://amzn.to/3zXcgqr).

üïπÔ∏è Items 1 to 3 include RCA out. If your TV doesn't support RCA out, use this [RCA to HDMI Convertor](https://amzn.to/3fjnRZ3).

> **NOTE:** This page uses Amazon Affiliate Links. Thanks for your continued support of this blog and [companion videos](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs).

In part three of my four part retro-computing handheld series, I open the box, power up, and play games on the "FateFan Retro Game Console with 500 Classic Games, Handheld Game Console Supporting 2 Players TV Connection, 1020 mAh Rechargeable Battery (Green)"; an almost identical model to the LiNKFOR. Or is it? Let's find out.

## Retro Gaming Handhelds Comparison Table

Each unit has unique features and I found it difficult to compare them without a table. My table is in the embedded Google Sheet below or view directly by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18F2VdasK79-lrjHz8jJKqSnqtliHu4gak_LHxMsmsMA/edit?usp=sharing).

<iframe width="100%" height=375px src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRWTY_jl6B3ZKV_AWtv_bxFXq4vcV-znnsOuUeCL5h0zZY9eUFrIiYS9d9JIQu5H7gMS9qAONhOag5D/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

I will add to this table and when I do, I will update this blog post. This post is the landing page for my retro gaming handheld experiences. Before I open the first handheld game console, below is the unit I use to benchmark all other units.

That concludes the look at the TRIMUI/PowKiddy. Time to compare all four and make final recommendations.

## Conclusion, Comparison, and Recommendation

I'll compare all four of the handhelds and make a final recommendation in the final video (link coming soon). For now, I hope you enjoy this fun experiment. While not every handheld is a winner, trying them out makes every experience like Christmas morning!
