In a previous video and companion blog post I took a look at [the FlashROM 99 for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A](https://www.stevencombs.com/flashrom99). 

The [FinalGROM 99 by endlos99](https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/) is a significant enhancement to FLASHROM 99

Runs .ROM and .GROM files.

Will not operate on QI motherboards (copy from previous post).

Advanced modes provide RAM and GRAM to programs. It allows a running program to reload another program from SD card or to dump its state to SD card. 

All firmware of the FinalGROM 99 can be updated by SD card

> **NOTE:** GROM filenames must not exceed 8 characters AND must end in¬†`G`. A ROM filename must have more than 8 characters OR must not end in¬†`D`¬†or¬†`G`._
