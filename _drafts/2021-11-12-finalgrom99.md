In another [video](https://youtu.be/UZQrSzeLSPg) and [companion blog post](https://www.stevencombs.com/flashrom99) I look at [the FlashROM 99 for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A](https://www.stevencombs.com/flashrom99). This modern cartridge, combined with a SD card, provides access to 171 .ROM games and applications. As I'm [new to the world of the TI-99/4A](https://www.stevencombs.com/first-ti994a), I chose to purchase the FlashROM 99. I had compatibility concerns regarding a "Quality Improved (QI)" version of the TI-99/4A motherboard. As I learned, I do not have a QI board and can use all modern devices.

After my look at the FlashROM 99, [retroCombs supporter](https://www.stevencombs.com/supporters), Jeffrey Phipps, sent a generous donation via [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/retroCombs), that covered the cost of an updated device, The [FinalGROM 99 by endlos99](https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/). Jeffrey asked that I use the funds to purchase the hardware for the open source FinalGROM 99 and compare it to the FlashROM 99. I immediately made the purchase and am now making good on my promise. Thank you, Jeffrey! I'm appreciative of your support of the blog and the YouTube channel.

Let's dig in and discover the differences between these two device.

## FinalGROM 99 Hardware

I purchased the FinalGROM 99 from the same vendor used to purchase my FlashROM 99; [The Brewing Academy](https://thebrewingacademy.com/products/texas-instruments-finalgrom-99) (TBA). The cost, $85, was a significant increase from the $35 cost of the FlashROM 99. This is why I am appreciative of Jeffrey's donation! Additional colors are available for $10, but I chose basic black to keep the cost, plus shipping, under the donation level.

Part of this process will be to determine if this upgraded hardware is worth the additional $50.

The case is a TBA 3D print and uses PLA. It has the familiar 3D printed layers. TBA includes a nice feature; the Texas Instruments and TBA logo on the top.

The case is solid and the TBA print is substantial. Two Philips’ head screws, that are not flush with the case, hold the case together. Like the FlashROM 99, I worry that these screw heads will scratch my TI-99/4A. The FlashROM 99 never did and I'm holding out hope this one won't either.

Like the FlashROM 99, the label design on the front of the FlashROM 99 is nice but is pealing off. I continue my recommendation that TBA to find a different adhesive.

The PLA encases the electronic components. The SD card reader is securely attached to the circuit board. The SD Card seats with a click. Press in on the SD Card to hear another click and it releases from the reader. The LED is bright. The reset button is a concern. They made it from PLA and it is flimsy. It works, but could be more substantial.

<!-- The cartridge offers advanced modes that provide RAM and GRAM to programs. It allows a running program to reload another program from SD card or to dump its state to SD card. All firmware of the FinalGROM 99 can be updated by SD card. -->

## Prepare an SD Card

The first step is to find a small  and [inexpensive SD Card](https://amzn.to/3DJxDxp). After you purchase, or better, find in your bin of spares, format it to FAT32. I will not cover this process since there are many examples online no matter what operating system you use.

There are limitations to the SD card filenames. Case is ignored and all files must match the 8.3 file scheme. The eighth character must always be a `g` for GROM files. The recommendation is that you never rename cartridge "dumps."

Whereas the FlashROM 99 used ROM files, the FinalGROM handles both ROM and GROM files. What's the difference? I found a Stack Exchange [What was the purpose of GROM (vs ROM) in the TI-99/4a? - Retrocomputing Stack Exchange](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8700/what-was-the-purpose-of-grom-vs-rom-in-the-ti-99-4a) discussion that does a good job describing the differences between ROM, GRAM, and GROM files. The FinalGROM 99 handles both ROM and GROM files.

In summary and per the [FinalGROM 99 by endlos99](https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/) page:

> …don't rename cartridge dumps. GROM filenames must not exceed 8 characters AND must end in G. ROM filename must have more than 8 characters OR must not end in D or G. For all images, there is always a main file that is used for help texts or RAM/GRAM configurations. For GROM and mixed images, the main file is the G file, for ROM-only files this is the C file or the actual filename of a single-file image.

Time to learn more about ROM and GROM images.

### ROM Files

ROM images are the binary files created from the TI solid state cartridges. Extracting the data places raw machine code into the file which is commonly found in a `.BIN` format. These files can be up to 32K. Many image files require the use of a 32Kb Sidecar RAM expansion unit.

ROM Image files use a name similar to `gameorapplication.bin`.

### GROM files

GROM images, "dumped" from solid state cartridges, can be single or multiple files. Below is a mixed image (ROM and GROM) with common image file names:

```
helloc.bin
hellod.bin
hellog.bin
```

In this example, the file `helloc.bin` is a ROM image up to 960 KB, the file `hellod.bin` is an optional ROM bank that is 8 KB, and `hellog.bin` is the GROM file which can be up to 40Kb in size.

Unless you plan to "dump" images files from cartridges yourself, you might wonder where you can obtain these files.

## Obtaining `.ROM` and `.GROM` Files

The easiest way to obtain an SD card full of compatible files is to add the $25 [TBA's 8 gb SD card for FinalGROM99 (FG99) TI 99/4a](https://thebrewingacademy.com/collections/sd-cards/products/ti-99-4a-card-with-110-files) to your cart when you purchase your FinalGROM 99 from TBA and they will send you an "8 Gb micro SD & adapter card with 500+ files on it.  All for FinalGROM99, some will require additional equipment (Disk Drives, 32K expansion, etc)."

To source your own files, visit the [Index of /Cartridges/FinalGROM99](http://ftp.whtech.com/Cartridges/FinalGROM99/). Download the `.ZIP` file, decompress, and move the entire package to the root directory of your SD card. The FinalGROM 99, unlike the FlashROM 99, supports directories.

## FinalGROM 99 Use

FinalGROM 99 usage is similar to the FlashROM 99:

1. Insert the SD card into the cartridge.
2. Plug in the FinalGROM 99 into the cartridge slot.
2. Turn on the TI-99/4A. The default screen will display with a request to press any key. Wait for the FinalGROM 99 LED to turn off before you proceed. It takes about a second or two.
3. Press any key and a menu will appear asking to select `1` for `TI BASIC` or `2` for `FinalGROM 99` as shown in the image below:

    ![Selecting the FinalGROM 99 Option](link)

4. Select `2`. The FinalGROM 99 menu will appear as demonstrated on the left in the image below:

    ![FinalGROM 99 Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endlos99/finalgrom99/master/doc/selection.png)
    <sup>Image Courtesy of [FinalGROM 99 by endlos99](https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/)</sup>

5. In the example above, directories are listed. Select a directory by hitting the associated alpha-numeric character to the left of the directory and a new listing will display as shown in the right in the image above:

    >  **NOTE:** You cannot use the arrow keys and `⏎` to make a selection.

5. If over nine ROM/GROMs are listed, use `,` key to move down a screen and the `.` to move up a screen.
6. To Select a title, use the associated alpha-numeric character on the left of the title.

The current ROM is always be the default ROM, even when you power cycle the TI-99/4A, unless you reset the FinalGROM 99. Use the instructions below to use a new ROM:

1. Power cycle the TI-99/4A or press `Fn` + `QUIT` (preferred) to reboot the computer. The default screen will display. DO NOT PRESS ANY KEY!
2. Press the reset button on the FinalGROM 99. The LED will glow as it resets the FinalGROM 99. When the light turns off, press any key and return to step #3 in the prior list.

## Advanced Features

The FinalGROM99 steps up its FlashROM99 roots and provides interesting advanced features for developers and users. Let's take a look at a few user accessible capabilities.

### Help Viewer

With the FinalGROM 99, you can view image help files stored on the SD card using `FN-7` and then press the letter of the image. If no help text is found, the FinalGROM menu will appear. If help text is found, the program image will go "offline" and the text viewer will load. Use the keys below to use the text viewer:

- Press `E` or `X` to scroll the text one line at a time
- Press `B` or `␣` to scroll up and down a page at a time
- Press `F` to find text (case is ignored)
- Press `N` to find the next occurrence of a search string
- Press `Q` to return to the FinalGROM 99 menu.

To create your own help text, place text in a DIS/VAR 38 text file. These files can contain upper case and lower case letters. Files will be plain ASCII. Consecutive line breaks are merged into one. To insert an empty line, press `⏎` followed by a newline. Longer lines will wrap without proper line breaking. Modify the text color by including a hexadecimal color code in the first line as show in the line below:

    `>1E`

This line must start with a `>` and the first number denotes the foreground and the second number denotes the background color. If no color is given, the default color is used. Name the help file with the `.TXT` extension using the same name as image file as shown in the example below:

```
gamename.bin
gamename.txt
```

The name of the help text file must end in .TXT. The filename of the .TXT file must match the main filename of your image (see Filenames).

> **TIP:** Create your own help files to provide tips, tricks, and codes for games. Instructions for common features of applications is another use case.

### Dumping (REWRITE!!!)

To capture an image file state to save game high scores or application preferences, the FinalGROM provides the ability to "dump" ROM, GROM, or mixed images.




Dumping an image writes back some or all image files that are marked as RAM or GRAM. This selection is made by the dump initiator and can comprise the RAM bank, the GRAM bank, or both.

To initiate the dump, the sequence >99, "OKFG99", >99 followed by the file data and dump code >ffx3 must be sent, where x equals 1, 2, or 3 for RAM, GRAM, or RAM+GRAM, resp. During the dump, the cartridge logic needs exclusive access to the SRAM, so dumping can only be initiated from scratchpad RAM or expansion RAM. To detect when the dump has completed, the program must watch address >6000 (or more) for a non-zero word to appear. Note that loading a GROM-only programs will always set ROM address >6000 to value >9999.

Dumping saves entire files with RAM or GRAM content and overwrites the original image files on the SD card. For technical reasons, the dump cannot be written to new, non-existing files, so keep a copy of the original image around.

The repository contains sample code lib/dump_example.a99 and lib/gdump_example.gpl that may serve developers as a blueprint for dumping. The syntax requires the xas99 and xga99 assemblers, but the code is easily adapted to other assemblers as well.
