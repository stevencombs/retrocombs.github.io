Z80 - NABU Personal Computer & Keyboard - Vintage New Old Stock (Retro 80's)
Qty: 1,000 Available

SALE CONDITIONS:
As a condition of sale you must read, understand, and agree to the following:
1.) There is no Operating System (OS) and so you can't perform any functions with the NABU Computer. It just displays the NABU logo and monitors for an NABU Adaptor and keyboard. You need to have programming skills and an EPROM Emulator to write code and bring the computer to life. There are a number of vintage collectors who are buying these computers. And there is a growing community of developers working on them.
2.) These NABU Computers are from the early 80s and are "new old" stock. And so, there is no guarantee of performance, function, or operation of these computers. I test for several basic computer functions before I ship, so at that point, they run. I only ship computers that pass the tests and run. Because of the state and purpose of these computers, there is an absolute "No Return/No Refund Policy". You must understand these details as a condition of sale.

INTRODUCTION:
This Z80 computer is very cost effective and provides a terrific platform for projects or products. It would also make a great educational platform for courses in microcomputer hardware/software embedded systems training. They were manufactured by a major brand name, and they look just great. They are new old stock and we offer them at an incredible price.

HISTORY:
The NABU (Natural Access to Bi-directional Utilities) Computer was an early home computer system and a component of the NABU Network which operated from 1982 to 1985. The NABU Network was a closed network that operated over a cable TV system and was a precursor to the internet. The NABU Adaptor was the functional "modem" of the system that connected the NABU Computer to the NABU Network through a Cable TV provider. The computer could download applications and information from NABU Servers through the NABU Network. The download data rate was a very fast 6.4 megabytes per second (but upload was slow). It has been called, "The Internet - 10 years ahead of its time". The NABU project was heavily subsidized by the Canadian government and at its peak NABU had 900 employees. The NABU Computer originally cost $950.

MARKET:
Reasons why one might purchase a NABU Computer:
1.) To develop hardware (circuits) and/or software (code) for it.
2.) As a vintage computer collector.
3.) To appreciate its retro style and technology.
4.) As a present for one of the above.
