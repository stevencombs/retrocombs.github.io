Followers know during Vintage Computer Festival Midwest, I obtained a new to me Commodore PET. I'm not going to rehash that memory, but if you want to relive it, check out my [My Vintage Computer Festival Midwest 2022 Experience and Commodore PET Purchase](https://retrocombs.com/vcfmw-2022) post. In this post, I want to explore the question, should I (or you) upgrade a Commodore PET?

## About my Commodore PET

As I shared in an earlier video and blog post, I purchased my Commodore PET from Scott over at [Bonus Life Computers](https://bonuslifecomputers.com/). This model was a ...

Using a couple of sources of information, here's what I know about this Commodore PET 2001:

1. Property tags on the back of the computer tell me it was first put into service at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. It seems appropriate that this Commodore PET is back in the hands of an educator.
2. Chris Hutchinson's PET database tells me at some point the PET ended up at a Goodwill in Southern Nevada:

3. My assumption at this point is that Scott, over at Bonus Life Computers, purchased the PET from Goodwill's online store.

## What do you get if you don't upgrade?

It depends on the PET purchased. In my case, I would miss out on a whole world of Commodore PET goodness that I'll discuss later.

## First step, clean up!

Externally, the PET was clean and in good condition. Opening up the Commodore PET revealed an interior of dirt. Scott later mentioned that he wanted to clean the interior before VCFMW 2022 but ran out of time.

I was not adverse to a little cleaning and grabbed some alcohol, swabs, and a rag and got to work. I removed the motherboard to make clean up easier and inspected everything as I removed them for any damage. There as none.

## What upgrades did I make?

1. ROM/Memory upgrade from TFW8B for $0.00
2. Joystick connector from TFW8B for $0.00v
3. Joystick and audio from Jim, over at BIT ZEAL for $0.00

It turns out that #2 was not necessary so I could have saved a few bucks, but I'm happy I am able to support retro computing vendors and I may find a use for the adapter later.

It is important to note that upgrade #1 is required for the other two upgrades. Not doing this upgrade is a show stopper.

## How much did I spend on upgrades?



## What did my upgrades get me?



## Are the upgrades valuable?

Tape versus SD card

## Do I recommend upgrades?

One word. YES!
