During the COVID pandemic of 2020, I began earnestly creating video for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs). Along the way, I accumulated an insane number of USB webcams. Everything from cheap $25 fixed focus cameras to a brilliant Logitech Brio. I moved from capturing video using OBS Studio on my Mac to a dedicated audio/visual/streaming platform, the [ATEM Mini](https://amzn.to/3QzB7JA) followed by the [ATEM Mini Extreme Iso](https://amzn.to/3dJ3OVU). The ATEM Mini line, unlike another device I own - the [YoloBox Pro](https://amzn.to/3dDife1), does not support USB cameras.

To connect cameras to the ATEM Mini, you must have an HDMI out. This can be either HDMI, micro HDMI, or mini HDMI, as long as you have an adapter. But this does limit you to pricey cameras like my [Sony ZV1](https://amzn.to/3PE1VXG) and other popular streaming cameras like the Lumix G7. If you want multiple cameras in your studio, like I do, that's a pricey proposition. In this blog post and companion video, I'm going to introduce you to a product that can help. The [RGBLink TAO 1tiny on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3wibNji).
