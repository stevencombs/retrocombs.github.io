The MEGA65 is AVAILABLE! That was the virtual shout during early October 2021. The first 400, of which I snagged one, will ship sometime in late December, while another batch of 1000 will ship during Q2 of next year. As of this writing, there are [a few available](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0765-03-S001-MEGA65-highly-advanced-C64-and-C65-compatible-8-bit-computer?c=564). At around $850 USD, these pre-orders may be out of reach of some early adopters. If that's the case, there are two ways you can begin your MEGA65 journey while production increases and costs decrease during the next couple of years.

The first option I've covered; [Run a MEGA65 on your Mac using Xemu](https://www.stevencombs.com/xemu-on-mac) (or Linux/PC). This software solution has the advantage of being a free solution and I recommend it for anyone curious about [the MEGA65 project](https://www.mega65.org). It is a great way to get started; however, if you want build a hardware solution that costs less than a Dev Kit or original release models, you can purchase a [Nexys A7-100T FPGA Trainer Board](https://amzn.to/2Zj3BRX) for ‚âà$270; [or less if you are a student or educator](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/). Once you have this FPGA training board in hand, what's next? I'll cover that in this post and show you how to configure and use the board as a MEGA65.

Before you read the rest of this post, take a look at my companion video below.

## Nexys Versions

There are four Nexys boards that support the MEGA65 bitstream (more on bitstreams later):

1. Nexys4 - discontinued, available in limited numbers, and **used for this tutorial**.
2. Nexys4DDR - discontinued and available in limited numbers.
3. Nexys A7 - readily available, updated, and rebranded version of #1.

## Nexys4 A7 Anatomy Primer

Before using the MEGA65 bitstream on the Nexys4, it is important to understand the hardware. We will use the image below to touch on the important hardware features for this project.

![Nexys4 Hardware](/images/mega65/nexys4-board.png)

### Components



### Ports



### Controls

There are seven onboard micro-switches and we use three of this for the MEGA65 implementation as shown in the image below:

![Micro-switches](/images/mega65/nexys4-board-switches.png)

1. CPU RESET - Resets the FPGA with the current bitstream and does not clear FPGA memory contents.
2. PROG - Resets the FPGA, clears FPGA memory contents, and reloads the current bitstream.
3. BTND - {RESTORE} key alternative

You will use the buttons to operate the MEGA65 implementation later.

## Powering the Nexys4



### Micro-USB

Power

Serial Connection to PC (won't cover)
