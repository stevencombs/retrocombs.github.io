The MEGA65 is AVAILABLE! That was the virtual shout during early October 2021. The first 400, of which I snagged one, will ship sometime in late December, while another batch of 1000 will ship during Q2 of next year. As of this writing, there are [a few available](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0765-03-S001-MEGA65-highly-advanced-C64-and-C65-compatible-8-bit-computer?c=564). At around $850 USD, these pre-orders may be out of reach of some early adopters. If that's the case, there are two ways you can begin your MEGA65 journey while production increases and costs decrease during the next couple of years.

The first option I've covered; [Run a MEGA65 on your Mac using Xemu](https://www.stevencombs.com/xemu-on-mac) (or Linux/PC). This software solution has the advantage of being a free solution and I recommend it for anyone curious about [the MEGA65 project](https://www.mega65.org). It is a great way to get started; however, if you want build a hardware solution that costs less than a Dev Kit or original release models, you can purchase a [Nexys A7-100T FPGA Trainer Board](https://amzn.to/2Zj3BRX) for ≈$270; [or less if you are a student or educator](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/). Once you have this FPGA training board in hand, what's next? I'll cover that in this post and show you how to configure and use the board as a MEGA65.

Before you read the rest of this post, take a look at my companion video below.

## MEGA65 Developer's Guide

The [MEGA65 Developer Guide](https://files.mega65.org?id=ffd575e5-5d9c-47ff-b553-fcec80fd77a3) is part of a series of MEGA65 user's guides. With a focus on tools and techniques programmers need to develop MEGA65 software, chapter XX includes instructions to build a MEGA65 using a Nexys Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Prior to the MEGA65 Dev Kit and the MEGA65, these developer FPGA boards were used to develop the MEGA65 bitstream. These boards share the same Xilinx processor <IS THIS CORRECT> found in the Dev Kit and the MEGA65.

Due to the similarities, bitstreams for this FPGA are released concurrently with bitstreams for the Dev Kit and the MEGA65. Because of this, you can purchase a Nexys4, load a bitstream and the necessary files on a microSD card and build your own MEGA65, sans case and external floppy drive. There are other limitations, but in general, if you want a hardware device to play on while you wait for your MEGA65 to arrive, this is an option. Let's build a MEGA65 by selecting an appropriate FPGA board.

## Nexys FPGA Versions

There are three Neyxs FPGA boards that support the MEGA65 bitstream (more on bitstreams later):

1. [Nexys4](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-4-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board/) - discontinued and available in limited numbers.
2. [Nexys4DDR](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/start) - discontinued and available in limited numbers.
3. [Nexys A7](https://amzn.to/2Zj3BRX) - readily available, updated, and rebranded version of #1.

I'll demonstrate install on the Nexys4 that I was able to buy from Digilent for ≈$200. Setup for all three versions is identical.

## Unbox the Nexys4

The Nexys4 comes in a plastic case similar to a DVD case but thicker. The case includes the Nexys4 and a micro USB cable. It does not include instructions. Those are available online as I discuss in the section below.

![Nexys4 and Case](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-case.jpg)

<!-- Video on camera -->

## Nexys4 A7 Anatomy Primer

Before using the MEGA65 bitstream on the Nexys4, it is important to understand the input/output (I/O) features of the hardware necessary for this project as shown in the image below. I will not cover every hardware feature. See the [Nexys A7 Reference Manual](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/reference-manual), which I used as a reference, for this information.

![Nexys4 Hardware](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-board.png)

### Micro USB

The micro USB port provides two functions: power and a serial connection. This project will use the micro USB port to provide power to the Nexys4 since I don't have an external power supply. I won't cover the serial connection in detail; however, you can use this port to connect the Nexys4 to a Mac or PC using [M65 Connect](https://files.mega65.org?id=5919a8b8-c23c-4616-9a52-37e077076638) or the [MEGA65 command line tools](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-tools) to manage and control the MEGA65.

### Power Supply

You can provide power to the board using a micro USB port, a barrel jack, or a battery:

1. Micro USB port - Use a USB power supply that provides 4.5VDC to 5.5VDC and at least 1A. For this project, use 2 to 3A as reading the SD card may require additional power to operate reliably.
2. Barrel Jack - Use a power supply with a coax, center-positive 2.1mm internal-diameter plug that deliver 4.5VDC to 5.5VDC and at least 1A.
3. Battery - Maximum voltage is 5.5VDC. The minimum voltage depends on the application. USB host function (J5) require at least 4.6V. Other applications may require the minimum voltage of 3.6V.

I used the micro USB port with a Kano Kit wall wart. The specifications are below:

* Input: 100-240 VAC 50/60Hz 0.6A Max
* Output: 5.25V 2.5A
* Model: 16445001-02B

Jumper JP3 selects USB as the power source as shown below:

![Power Supply Jumpers](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-jp3-power.jpg)

## Input/Ouput (I/O) Devices

The Nexys4 includes a Slide Switches, a USB port for HID keyboard/mouse devices, VGA for video out, and a 3.5mm jack for audio.

### Slide Switches

The slide switches at the bottom of the board are not required; however, it is important that all switches are in the down position, or away from the corresponding LED display as shown in the image below:

![Nexys4 Slide Switches](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-slide-switches.jpg)

### USB Keyboard

Finding a USB keyboard that works with the Nexys4 is the hardest part of this project. While researching this project on the MEGA65 Discord, there were many comments that I would need the "cheapest," "dirtiest," "nastiest" keyboard I could find. Mechanical keyboards would not work, nor would keyboards with trackpads or USB hub ports. The following keyboards did NOT work:

* Monoprice MP-M10B
* Unicomp M
* KeyChron K2
* Aukey KM-G9
* Kano KC-KBR101
* Generic Handheld RT-MWK01

My penchant for mechanical keyboards was a detriment to this project. Nexys4 users on the MEGA65 Discord channel recommended a Dell keyboard. Searching through a recycle bin, I found two Dell keyboards:

1. LT100
2. KB216t

The Dell LT100, shown below, worked while the KB216t provided the same non-working result of the previous six make and models.

![Dell LT100 Keyboard](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/dell-keyboard.jpg)

> **NOTE:** Discord user Lydon is [asking everyone to share the keyboards](https://discord.com/channels/719326990221574164/903079038015389716/903195771850063883) that do and do not work to compile a list. The process is simple, but you will need a *NIX OS and use the `lsusb` command. Lydon describes the process in his post.

### VGA Device

A VGA port provides video out. You can connect this port to a VGA monitor or a capture device. I used a [Black Magic Design ATEM Mini](https://amzn.to/3GEikIn) with [VGA to HDMI adapter](https://amzn.to/3BrB75X) to capture video for the companion blog post as shown in the image below:

![VGA to HDMI Adapter](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/vga-to-hdmi.jpg)

### Audio

A 3.5 mm audio jack provides audio out. This can be a headphone, powered speaker, or capture device. I can use either the ATEM mini or my VGA to HDMI adapter to capture the audio.

## Use the Nexys4 Self-Test

Before installation of the MEGA65 bitstream, test the board to make sure it is operational. To use the on-board Nexys4 self-test, and with the Nexys4 off, move the pin on the *external configuration jumper (SD/USB)* to USB as shown in the image below:

![Nexys4 Self Test Jumper Settings](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-jp1-sdusb.jpg)

Turn on the Nexys4 and the self-test will display as shown in the image below:

![Nexys4 Self-Test](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-self-test.jpg)

<!-- Image on Cloner -->

The reference manual lists the self-test functions below:

1. The VGA port displays feedback from the onboard microphone, temperature sensors, accelerometer, RGB LEDs, and USB Mouse.
2. The user LEDs illuminate when the corresponding user switch is placed in the on position.
2. The tri-color LEDs are controlled by some user buttons. Pressing BTNL, BTNC, or BTNR causes them to illuminate either red, green, or blue, respectively. Pressing BTND causes them to begin cycling through many colors. Repeatedly pressing BTND will turn the two LEDs on or off.
3. Pressing BTNU will trigger a 5 second recording from the onboard PDM microphone. This recording is then immediately played back on the mono audio out port. The status of the recording and playback is displayed on the user LEDs. The recording is saved in the DDR2 memory.
5. Connecting a mouse to the USB-HID Mouse port will allow the pointer on the VGA display to be controlled. Only mice compatible with the Boot Mouse HID interface are supported.
6. The seven-segment display will display a moving snake pattern.

<!-- Video on camera and Cloner -->

## Prepare a microSD

With operational hardware, the next step is to prepare a microSD that will boot the Nexys4 with the MEGA65 bitstream. The first step is to format the microSD.

### Format microSD

Format the disk using the steps below:

1. Insert a microSD card into your Mac or PC.
2. On a Mac, open the *Disk Utility* application.
3. Format the microSD card as a single FAT32 partition
4. The name of the microSD card is unimportant, but consider "NEXYS4-65".
5. Leave the microSD card in the computer.

The microSD can now host a bitstream and boot to the Nexys4.

### Download the MEGA65 bitstream

A bitstream is the data we load into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to configure the Nexys4 hardware as a MEGA65. Download the [latest version of the bitstream](https://files.mega65.org?id=70ac2bd6-7967-4094-aabe-d9af3a369816) located on the [MEGA65 FileHost](https://files.mega65.org/).

### Copy the bitstream to microUSB

Copy the bitstream to the root directory of the microSD card. Ensure there are no other files on the microSD card. Later we will format this same microSD card and add files to create a boot disk. Keep a copy of the bitstream on the computer. You will need it later in the process.

### Boot the bitstream

Use the bitstream to boot the Nexys4 with the instructions below:

1. Place the microSD card into the Nexys4 microSD card reader.
2. Plug in a USB keyboard.
3. Connect a VGA display device.
4. Connect a micro USB cable connected to a power supply to the micro USB port.
5. Turn on the Nexys4 and the MEGA65 on-boarding screen below will display. This screen verifies the MEGA65 is operational.

    ![MEGA65 Boots on Nexys4](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/mega65-onboarding.jpg)

6. Turn off the Nexys4.

With an operational MEGA65 Nexys4 bitstream, we can now format the micro SD Card for MEGA65 use.

### Format a microSD on the MEGA65

<!-- Record new formatting video and capture Utility screen -->

Use the steps below to boot the `MEGA65 Utility Menu` and format the micro SD card.:

1. Turn off the Nexys4.
2. Hold the ALT key on the keyboard.
3. Turn on the Nexys4.
4. Release the ALT key when the Utility menu loads as shown below:

    ![Utility Menu](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/utility-menu.jpg)

5. Type `0` to select the micro SD card.
6. Type `DELETE EVERYTHING` + `⏎` to verify the format option
6. Once the format process is complete, turn off the Nexys4. Ignore the restart options in the menu. The micro SD care can no longer boot the Nexys4 because it is empty and without a bitstream.
7. Remove the microSD card from the Nexys4.

The microSD card has two partitions; One hidden and used by the MEGA65 to store configuration files, and another that is user accessible to store [SD Card Essentials](https://files.mega65.org?id=0fb941fe-5c5f-4608-b0f1-32849d4a8dff), a `[.ROM](https://files.mega65.org?id=8aec2fba-3b0a-4677-80ae-7a7f5f4f0cb8)` file, and `[.D81](https://files.mega65.org?id=7168bacc-a6bf-4a38-b205-3a0a209b6657)` disk images.

### Copy files to micro SD card

Move to a computer and copy the required files using the steps below:

1. Insert the microSD card in a Mac or PC.
2. Download the following files:

    * [SD Card Essentials](https://files.mega65.org?id=0fb941fe-5c5f-4608-b0f1-32849d4a8dff)
    * [MEGA65 OPEN ROM](https://files.mega65.org?id=8aec2fba-3b0a-4677-80ae-7a7f5f4f0cb8) or [C65-MEGA65 Kernal ROM](https://files.mega65.org?id=54e69439-f25e-4124-8c78-22ea7ddc0f1c) (Requires Dev Kit or MEGA65 purchase.
    * A `.D81` disk image. I recommend [BASIC.D81](https://files.mega65.org?id=7168bacc-a6bf-4a38-b205-3a0a209b6657) that contains all BASIC examples from the *MEGA65 BASIC 65 Command Reference*.

3. Copy the bitstream downloaded earlier to the root directory of the microSD card.
2. Decompress the SD Essentials `.rar` file.
3. Copy all the files to the root directory of the microSD card.
3. Rename the file ROM file to `MEGA65.ROM`
4. Copy the `MEGA65.ROM` file to the root directory of the microSD card.
4. Copy the `BASIC.D81` file to the root directory of the microSD card.
5. Eject the microSD card from the computer.

The microSD card is now ready to use in the Nexys4.

### Boot the Nexys with the microSD card

Everything is prepared to boot the Nexys4 as a MEGA65 using the steps below:

1. Insert the microSD card into the Nexys4 microSD card reader.
2. Power on the Nexys4 FPGA using the power switch. The Nexys4 will boot and after a few seconds will display the screen below:

![MEGA65 Start Up Screen](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/mega65-boot-screen.jpg)

## Operating the MEGA65 on the Nexys4

Using the MEGA65 isn't an intuitive experience. There are several hardware controls the new user needs to know to use the MEGA65. I'll cover these next.

### USB-Keyboard Key Mapping

Using a PC keyboard to emulate a Commodore keyboard can be a frustrating experience. This is one of the reasons that the Dev Kit and MEGA65 provide an exceptional user experience that recreates official 1980s computing. There is something you can do to make the experience better.

If you plan to use this setup long-term. I recommend you purchase these [4Keyboard brand Commodore 64 keyboard stickers](https://amzn.to/38KRcHN). I use them on my [Combian pi/400](https://www.stevencombs.com/combianpi400-1) and they serve as a great reminder of the keys needed to activate colors or other Commodore keys not found on modern keyboards.

![Combian pi/400](https://www.stevencombs.com/combianpi400/key-caps.jpg)

Below are important U.S. keyboard mappings you need to get started using the MEGA65 on the Nexys4 since the original Commodore key mappings are not the same as modern keyboard mappings:

| PC Key | MEGA65 Function |
|:--|:--|
| PAGE UP | RESTORE |
| ESC | RUN/STOP |
| WINDOWS | MEGA |
| ` | ← |
| @ | " |
| ^ | & |
| & | ' |
| * | ( |
| ( | ) |
| - | + |
| = | - |
| [ | @ |
| ] | * |
| \\ | = |
| ; | : |
| ' | ; |
| DEL | ↑ |
| INS | £ |
| F1 | 40/80 Column Mode |
| F3 | Directory |
| Shift-F3 | DIR "*=PRG" |
| F5 | Forward a Word |
| F7 | Back a Word |
| Shift-F7 | Monitor |
| F12 | Delete |
| NUM Lock | Activate WASD Joystick Mode |

### On-screen Keyboard

Useful for the [MEGAPhone development](https://c65gs.blogspot.com/2019/06/megaphone-prototype-is-taking-shape.html), the MEGA65 bitstream includes an on screen keyboard that is useful for the MEGA65.

![MEGAPhone On Screen Keyboard](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qiBAGHyn3iE/XPel9wEv_YI/AAAAAAAAHpY/L8tpz2hCddkYGaX9hT39G9B7T5ujuOjLQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190605_205004.jpg)
<sup>Image Courtesy: MEGA65 Blog Post</sup>

The virtual keyboard will assist in understanding the keyboard mappings when you use a U.S. keyboard layout. There are two ways to activate the onscreen keyboard:

*Configuration Mode*

1. Hold the `[ALT]` key and turn on the power or press the PROG micro-switch on the Nexys4 board.
2. Choose option `3` when the *Configuration Menu* displays.

The virtual keyboard shown in the image below will display.

![MEGA65 Utility Application Virtual Keyboard](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/virtual-keyboard-utility.jpg)

*Immediate Mode Keyboard*

<!-- Capture from Cloner as image -->

1. Boot the MEGA65 bitstream on the Nexys4.
2. Hold the `[MEGA]` key (or Windows key on a Dell keyboard) and press `[TAB]`. The *Matrix Mode Debugger* will appear.
3. Use one of the two commands below to display a semi-transparent virtual keyboard:

    - `s ffd3615 ff` + `⏎` – display the keyboard at the top of the screen
    - `s ffd3615 ff ff` + `⏎` – display the keyboard at the center of the screen

4. Press `[MEGA]` + `[TAB]` to exit the *Matrix Mode Debugger* and you will have an overlay of the keyboard as you type as shown in the image below:

    ![Virtual Keyboard](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/virtual-keyboard.jpg)

5. To hide the virtual keyboard, press `[MEGA]` + `[TAB]` and type the command `s ffd3615 7f` + `⏎` followed by another `[MEGA]` + `[TAB]`. Huge thanks to [Paul](https://twitter.com/servalpaul) for this one!

The virtual keyboard, and the *Matrix Mode Debugger* have display issues. The right and left side are cut off, as seen in the image above. Checking in with Paul again, [he shared](https://discord.com/channels/719326990221574164/903079038015389716/904489665116114974):

> "Yes, this is a known problem. It was designed for 800 wide on the handheld, not 720 of the desktop."

### FPGA Micro-Switch Controls

There are seven onboard micro-switches and we use the three shown below for the MEGA65 implementation:

![Micro-switches](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/nexys4-board-switches.jpg)

1. CPU RESET - Resets the FPGA with the current bitstream and does not clear FPGA memory contents.
2. PROG - Resets the FPGA, clears FPGA memory contents, and reloads the current bitstream.
3. BTND - `[RESTORE]` key alternative

We won't use the other buttons for this demonstration but will use those three to operate the MEGA65.

### Joystick Emulation

There is no joystick port on the Nexys4 but the bitstream provides joystick emulation via the keyboard using the steps below:

1. Press the `[NUM LOCK]` key on the keyboard
2. Joystick #1 controls use the WASD format; `W` = ↑, `A` = ←, `S`= ↓, and `D` = →. The left shift key or `0` on the num pad = fire button.
3. Joystick #2 uses the cursor keys and the cursor keys on the num pad. Space `␣` = fire button.

## Basic Nexys4 Use

With a bitstream on the Nexys4 and an understanding of how to operate the device, watch the companion video for a demonstration of ways to use the MEGA65 to run your favorite Commodore 64 software or new MEGA65 software from the FileHost.

## Final Thoughts

1. If you build your own Nexys4 based MEGA65 and you have questions, please join me over on the [MEGA65 Discord](https://discord.gg/48ErjZne) on the #nexys channel. I'll be sure to do my best to answer questions as will the rest of the community.
2. Getting the MEGA65 bitstream working on the Nexys4 was a journey. It started with a YouTube livestream, where I had lots of help troubleshooting the keyboard, to this complete set of instructions and companion video. It's been a blast.
2. What's next you ask? You didn't? I have an answer. I do have another project planned with this Nexys4 and if I can get it working, I think it will be fun to share.
3. The Nexys4, and the MEGA65, have PMOD ports. These ports provide hardware additions and I'd love to see a joystick port addition.
4. Why would I install a MEGA65 bitstream on a Nexys4 when I have a MEGA65 Dev Kit and a MEGA65 on the way? You sure are full of questions today! The answer is, to understand the entire hardware experience. The Nexys4 was the original development board. Working through this exercise gives me the full gamut of hardware experiences. A perk for the reader is that users who don't have a Dev Kit or feel the MEGA65 is not within their financial resources, now have a less expensive hardware option to learn and experiment with while they save or wait for a MEGA65 price drop.
