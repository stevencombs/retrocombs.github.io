Freewrite

"Freewrite" by Astrohaus. The first word haunted me; the amalgam of two words made me ponder; could a single use device make me, "write free" and would it help me to "free write" a story to add to the pantheon of of existing stories found in the cold dark city.

(INTRO SOUND TITLE AND MUSIC)

I grabbed the brown cardboard box at each corner and noted its heft. What were these words? I was intrigued and inspired by the words that adorned the strapping tape but was not distracted by my mission; open the box or as other put it, the unboxing.

I cut through the series of words and opened the flaps of the box. Inside the box was another; surrounded by packaging. I released the interior box from its captivity and placed it on the table in front of me. Again, the words Freewrite were front and center. Flipping the box over revealed a secret. Freewrite is a smart typewriter with an e-ink screen and a mechanical keyboard that will seamlessly back up my writing to the cloud. I was intrigued. The images excited me as I flipped the box on all sides to reveal even more technical tidbits about the device.

A side of the box revealed the sexy profile of this retro inspired but decidedly high tech device. The lines made me giddy with anticipation. I wanted to put my fingers all over the keys. To longly gaze at the e-ink display. To watch the bits fly through the air as they sync to the cloud. It was a thing of beauty and I knew taking it with me to diners and coffee shops would make me the envy of every writer within view.

I cut through and then ripped off the transparent covering using my Swiss made cutting tool. One last time, I reviewed the box and noted the name, Freewrite but then, from out of nowhere, another name, Astrohaus. I knew that name. Was it from my time in Manhattan investigating the Rittenhouse murder? No, because as I remembered, that incident never occurred.

No, my memory brought me back to a Kickstarter campaign from 2014. Astrohaus was finally out of the seedy side of the Internet and had gone legit selling the Freewrite in over 50 countries and releasing over 115 million words into the cloud. But would their device inspire me to add to that collection of words?

I was excited to remove the outer covering to reveal what was inside. I sliced the transparent covering to gain access to the box. Slowly I lifted the top of the box. The Freewrite was covered in a fibrous cloth that denied my viewing of the device. Even the interior box packaging was gorgeous. The Freewrite was held into place by two black side supports. I slowly pulled them off and moved the cover. As I lifted the device, I noticed the weight. It was hefty, but in a good way.

Delaying my desire to put fingers on the keys, I noticed a small package containing a corded and fashionable black and white USB-C cable complete with strap and that word, Freewrite, on each connector. I'll use this to charge the Freewrite but I will need my own power brick, I lamented.

Astrohause included a cute sticker of the device and a user's manual. The user's manual is small, simple, and includes everything I need to operate the smart typewriter. I was ready to "get flowing" and looked once more, longingly, over the beautiful device.

On the upper left of the device was a switch labeled folder. Three cryptic options included A, B, and C. The switch was substantial and made a thunking sound as I cycled through the options. Another similar Wi-Fi switch was on the upper-right of the device with three additional options, off, on, and new. Between these switches was a gorgeous e-ink display with good contrast and sharp text. The display was easy on my eyes. Finally, the keyboard. One last time, I refrained from touching the keys and delayed my gratification.

I took a look at the device's backside. There was a crevice and within the crevice, a handle! I pulled the handle out. It was firm and substantial. Just right for a night on the town full of intrigue and writing. I put the handle back in its storage position because it was finally time. Time to tickle the keys.

I spun the Freewrite into place and began to frantically tap on the mechanical keys. They were everything I'd dreamed. Box brown switches with great travel and a fantastic sound. Single finger typing was fun and I could imagine what full on touch-typing on the device would feel like but that would again have to wait.

I reviewed the instruction manual and then pushed the red toggle switch. It traveled deep into the all aluminum shell of the Freewrite and then bottomed out. There wasn't a click to acknowledge a power contact. It was an old-school feeling that felt, well, write(right)!

And about the aluminum shell. It is substantial, curved, hefty, and oh so sexy. This is a device with a mid-century styling that contains minimalist twenty-first century technology to provide a writing experience that is both retro and modern and the same time. There was no doubt in my mind, this was a premium product and not for the faint of heart. It was for the serious writer who knew that what stood between them and their publisher was their first draft. This was a device for drafting the next great novel.

I considered my words as the Freewrite began to boot up and begin the setup process. The e-ink display fading and drawing a progress indicator over and over until the device was ready. I made a first attempt to type while creating an account for the device. The typing experience was everything I dreamed. Typing felt like I was on an electric typewriter back from my youth, but instead of keys striking paper to place ink, the e-ink display displayed the words instantaneously. The faster I typed, the slower the display of characters but unlike a traditional typewriter, not once did the keys lock together. All-in-all, it felt right. Except it was missing something. What was it? Oh, yes. The ding of the bell at the end of each line as the carriage return moved from right to left greeting each key strike.

I wanted to take time for extending typing. Did the battery have a charge? I connected the USB-C cable to the Freewrite and to power. The Freewrite displayed a charging indicator but not an amount of charge. I didn't know what I was doing. It was time for me to learn more about the Freewrite and grabbed the user's manual.

I read about the folder switch and now understood that the device allows three concurrent writing projects and this switch toggles between them. It was a retro way to move between documents and eased any worry about complicated file management.

Intrigued by this left switch, I operated the right switch. I moved the Wi-Fi switch to new and the e-ink screen prompted me to connect to a Wi-Fi network. I choose my home network and entered my credentials. The Freewrite and I now have a special relationship. It now knows one of my valuable secrets, my home Wi-Fi password. Time will tell this is a long term trusted relationship. I moved the switch back to the on position knowing that if I ever needed to join another network, I would switch back. It wasn't a finicky device.

The instructions offered many other options but I wasn't interested in those. It was time to type. I found a comfortable location, grabbed a libation, and began drafting the next great novel. The words danced out of my brain, through my fingers and into the Freewrite. The distraction free environment provided me with focus. Limiting my writing syntax formatting using Markdown kept the thoughts flowing without the need to include complicated keyboard combinations. Even though I can change the font size of the letters, the default was perfect for writing and discouraged me from looking at my previous sentences.

And then it happened! Dang, I noticed a mistake in a previous line. Now what, I said to myself. I knew the device wasn't designed for heavy editing. That was never the intent, but I couldn't help it. I wanted to fix my error. I'd used the Backspace key, with much success, to correct errors on the same line, but now how do I move to a previous line without backspacing entire sentences? There aren't individual cursor keys, again reminiscent of an old typewriter.

Oh, but there are cursor key functions, the user's manual informed. Hold down the red NEW key and use the popular `WASD` keyboard layout. To move the cursor word at a time, hold `NEW` + `A` or `D`. To move up or down a paragraph at a time, hold `NEW` + `W` or `S`. And then I saw them. Cursor key markings on the front of the `WASD` keys. These markings were reminiscent of another device from my past, a Commodore computer.

I found that to move back or forward a character, I had to hold down the `SHIFT` key along with the previous `A` or `D` combination. Using `SHIFT` along with `W` or `S` moved the cursor up and down one line. While not intuitive at first, upon successive use, this cursor functionality became more natural and intuitive. This layout reduced keys on the keyboard while at the same time provides the keys you need. Are there are other keyboard combinations I pondered?

The room began to darken and I noticed the display glow eerily. The e-ink display had a soft back-lit screen that provided enough light to work in the evening. But a small amount of ambient light was required to see the keys on the keyboard. This was no uppity backlit keyboard and I didn't need that light. I was a professional and could type in the dark if I had to.

Wait, what was this? In the dark I noticed a key. A `Special` key. Literally, a key called `Special`. I tapped it and noticed the small display under the e-ink display changed. The Freewrite cycled through displays that showed:

* Date and cloud sync status
* Reading time, words and character counts
* Retro clock with hands, not digits
* Date view
* Chronograph to capture amount of time writing
* Blank display

Are there other options? I looked at the user's manual again to learn that holding the space bar will display the batter charge level, FINALLY, and verification that my words have been sync'd to the cloud. Finally an options menu is available by pressing the power button for two seconds but I botched my press. I didn't press long enough and was greeted by the image of a fellow writer, Poe. I pressed the power button again two times and this time was greeted by fellow writer, Asimov. What other writers would adorn my e-ink display when I put the device in standby with a single short press? I would need to figure that out later, for now, I needed to understand the options available on this device.

I finally pressed the button for the correct amount of time, about two seconds, and an options menu appeared. On the device, I could:

* Log Out of my account
* Change the font size
* Modify the screen brightness
* Install firmware updates
* Shutdown the device

I would later learn that there are other options using a web browser such as connecting the device to cloud services Dropbox or Google Drive, my preferred cloud. But that's a story for another day. I was content with what I had learned and ready to use the Freewrite to help finish a novel that has been in gestation since 2017. It's a fine tale of intrigue, action, and retro-computing, but alas, that too is for another day.
