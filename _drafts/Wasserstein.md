## Introduction

In this windy edition retroCombs Tech video, "Get ready to take your bird watching experience to the next level with the Wassersteen Bird Feeder for the Wyze Cam Outdoor. Say goodbye to boring bird feeders and hello to a high-tech solution that will make you the envy of all your bird watching friends.

The folks at Wassersteen asked if the Lovely Accountant and I wanted to take a look at the $70 Wassersteen Bird Feeder Camera Case Compatible with the Blink, Wyze, and Ring brands of security cameras. Since I'm a Wyze Cam fan and the Lovely Accountant is a birder, this seemed like a great opportunity for the two of us to collaborate on a video. Let's see what happened. I mean, what could go wrong when husband and wife record an outdoor video on a cold windy day?

## Wassersteen Items 

The Wassersteen team were kind enough to send over three items for us to take a look at:

- [Bird Feeder Camera Case for Ring, Blink, and Wyze Cam - $70](https://amzn.to/3lbpZIe)
- [Solar Panel for Wyze Cam Outdoor - $28](https://amzn.to/3l6e5ix)
- [Camera Gutter Mount - $18](https://amzn.to/3DKf4LN)

We'll take a look at the Bird Feeder and Solar Panel in this video. I'll share the Gutter Mount as a YouTube short later so make sure you hit that subscribe button below so you don't miss it. Now, let's see what happened when Nikki and I headed outside to give the products a look see.

## Unboxing

Did I mention it was a windy and cold February day in Indiana? I did. Okay, so expect some microphone wind noise. Apologies, but it won't distract from the products and the wind even ades to the fun.

## Final Thoughts

We were both impressed by the quality of the bird feeder and after consulation, we both decided we will mount the feeder on a pole in the backyard when Spring arrives; however, we wanted to mount on a tree to try out the strap because, admittedly, we were dubious it would hold. But it did! 

As you noticed, we did have some confusion with the instructions but the birdhouse and solar panel are intuitive enough to figure out if you think through the steps and consider what needs to happen before following steps. We are also hopeful this video might help.

We've been impressed with the solar panel. It keeps the Wyze Cam Outdoor charged and we've not had to bring it back inside. That's a good thing because when the bird house is mounted using the tree strap, it would be a pain in the neck to remove the camera for charging. On a pole with the included mount and mounting the solar panel on top using the Solar adapter, this makes a pretty slick setup for the Wyze Cam Outdoor. Let's talk a about this bird footage. Although the close ups are blurry,  that's a fault of the Wyze Cam Outdoor's field of view and has nothing to do with the bird feeder. Even blurry, the images are fun and we've used the bird house to watch some great live footage.

We're impressed with Wasserstein quality and we can't wait to try other accessories they manufacture. You can see a whole range of items on [their Amazon Store](https://amzn.to/3JKqt27) or [web site](https://wasserstein-home.com/) and links to both are in the video description below. A huge thanks to Wasserstein for the opportunity and if you are interested in other tech I use, check out these two videos.
