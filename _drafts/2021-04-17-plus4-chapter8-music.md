Introduction

Before you read the rest of this post, take a look at my companion video below.

## Series Information

This episode is a small part of my larger Commodore Plus/4 series. You can read the entire series and view additional resources at:

## Companion Disk Image

As I progress through the user's manual, I enter and execute sample programs. The link below is to a `.d81` image that contains every program from each episode. **Like the series, the image is not complete.**

[retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image](/plus4/plus4-users-manual.d81) - **UPDATED AS OF:** 2021-04-17

I use the following file name convention to make it easy to locate specific programs:

<img src="https://www.stevencombs.com/images/design/floppy-disk-small.png" align="right">Sample Program Name: `02 RCOMBS SCROLL.PRG`

* `02` - The chapter number
* `RCOMBS SCROLL` - my self assigned name for the BASIC program which will be immediately identifiable if you follow along.

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've taken the time to scan each chapter so you can read and follow along. Use the link below to view chapter 8:

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key     | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:--------|:--------------|:-----|:------------|
| `‚á™`     | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `[C=]`  | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `‚åÉ`     | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `‚éã`     | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `‚åÇ`     | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `‚å´`     | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `‚èé`     | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `‚áß`     | Shift         | `‚ê£`  | Space       |
| `‚Üë`     | Cursor Up     | `‚Üì`  | Cursor Down |
| `‚Üí`     | Cursor Right  | `‚Üê`  | Cursor Left |

## Final Thoughts

1. That concludes all eight chapters in the Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual; however, there's a whole lot more in the last half of the manual entitled, the *Plus/4 Encyclopedia*. Never fear, I plan to cover the best parts of that portion of the manual. There's good content in the back half of the manual.
