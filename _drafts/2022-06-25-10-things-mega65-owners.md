## Ten Things New MEGA65 Owners Should Know



### MEGA65 Color Palette BASIC Program

Since this video, I did release my MEGA65 Color Palette program [version 1.5 on the FileHost](https://files.mega65.org?id=1813f548-7280-4b73-9112-abc24b90892b). This new version includes the updates below:

1. Title decorations
2. Column headings
3. Color HEX codes (thanks Tayger!)
4. Fixes color display on first few lines if you use a custom screen in `AUTOBOOT.C65`.
