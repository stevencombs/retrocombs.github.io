A feature of the MEGA65 DevKit I miss with the production MEGA65 is the ability to "out-of-the-box" connect it to my Mac and use tools like *M65 Connect* or the command line tools *M65* or *MEGA65_FTP*. These tools allowed me to manage the internal SD card with my Mac without removing the SD card from the MEGA65. These features are available if you can locate a JTAG connector; however, these have a 52-week wait and are pricey at $50 plus shipping.

In this blog post and companion video, I'm going to show you how to get access to those tools by connecting the [$12 DSD TECH USB to TTL Serial Adapter with FTDI FT232RL](https://amzn.to/3trsIi3) between a Mac min and the MEGA65.

> <font color="red">**!!!WARNING!!!** This project requires you to remove the top of the MEGA65 and connect an external device to the MEGA65. While the risk is low, I do not take responsibility for your MEGA65.</font>

## Unbox the Adapter

The box includes three items:

1. Instruction manual in various languages
2. Six strand connector cable
3. USB to TTL serial adapter

The adapter includes a transparent plastic cover, is sturdy, and includes indicators LEDs such as power, transmit and receive. For ‚âà$13 I am pleased with the quality of the product. 

## Install the Adapter on the MEGA65

Below is an image of the pinouts to connect the adapter to the MEGA65.

I chose to route the cable through the cartridge port. This likely won't be a long-term solution. I could use one of the case punch outs, but I'm not ready to modify the case. It's has that new case smell! Below is an image of the adapter connected to the MEGA65.

## Connect the MEGA65 to a MAC using the Adapter

The next step is to connect the adapter to a USB A port on the Mac. I happen to have an extended USB port available close to the MEGA65, but you might need to use a [USB Extension Cable](https://amzn.to/38xt0fY). Below is my connection.

Optimally, I would embed the adapter and determine a way to add a port on the MEGA65. Have ideas? Drop a comment below.

## Using M65 Connect

You can download M65 Connect from the [MEGA65 FileHost](https://files.mega65.org). Version are available for [Mac](https://files.mega65.org?id=8d499f0a-062f-48e1-8cd0-a4aa035730b3), [Linux](https://files.mega65.org?id=e466d859-9aef-48b0-a4dd-720b0a846532), and [Windows](https://files.mega65.org?id=042e934f-c6e7-480f-8caa-4176be5ee784).

In the video I demonstrate the use of M65 Connect to:

1. Connect to the MEGA65
2. Take a screenshot
3. Type in a line of code using the Mac keyboard
4. View the contents of the MEGA65 internal SD card
5. Copy a .d81 image to the SD card

There's much more you can do with this app, but that's for another video; if there's interest.

## Using Command Line Tools

My blog post, [Build MEGA65 Tools on Mac OS X (Intel and M1) | And an intro to the MEGA65 community](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-tools), provides the instructions you need to install the MEGA65 command line tools on your Intel and M1 Mac.

I demonstrate the following using the command line tools:

### m65.osx

1. Send a line of code to the MEGA65 using:

    `./m65.osx -l /dev/??? -T '10 1+1'`
    
2. Continuously type using the Mac's keyboard:

    `m65 -l /dev/??? -t -`

### mega65_ftp.osx

To use the MEGA65 FTP tools,  you must first start the service using `./mega65_ftp.osx -l /dev/???`. A new prompt will appear to interact with the MEGA65. Below are examples.

1. List the contents of the internal SD card using the `dir` command.
2. List files on the FileHost and download my MEGA65 Color Palette BASIC Program from the FileHost directly to the internal SD Card using:

    ```
    fh
    fhget 96 
    ```
    
3. Use the `exit` command to quit and close the MEGA65 FTP connection.

## Conclusion

Adding this adapter to your MEGA65 is a MUST if you want to get the most out of the device. It does come with a modicum of risk since you have to open the MEGA65 and plug in wires but the result is worth it. Do yourself a favor and [order one now](https://amzn.to/3trsIi3)!
