As a MEGA65 DevKit owner, I've created [much content](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65) to share what's coming when my favorite Commodore "what could have been" retro computer is released. I'm not going to go into depth about the MEGA65. Check out my [MEGA65 page](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65) for that information. In this post, I will show you how to get started with the MEGA65 while you wait and without the need for hardware such as the DevKit.

In this post, I share how to install Xemu on Mac OS X. What's Xemu? Let's go right to the source:

> [Xemu](https://github.com/lgblgblgb/xemu) (full name: X-Emulators) is a collection of emulators running on Linux/Unix/Windows/MacOS of various (mainly 8-bit) machines, including - but not limited to - the Commodore LCD, Commodore 65 and MEGA65. And yes, that's an "X" in the name, not "Z" :)

The MEGA65 part of that description is what we are interested in. Let's get started setting up a complete MEGA65 emulation environment on your Mac.

> **NOTE:** I share the installation of Xemu on a Mac. I do not own a Windows computer and cannot help with that install process. If Linux users want these same instructions, drop be a comment below. I have a Manjaro Linux distribution installed and ready to go.

## YouTube Video: _retroCombs:  Starter Guide_

In the video below, I demonstrate how to install Xemu on Mac OS X to emulate a MEGA65.

## Links Mentioned in this Episode:

Below are the links I mention in the video. All Amazon links are affiliate links. Thanks for supporting the blog and the YouTube channel!

1. [MEGA65](https://mega65.org/)
2. [Xemu](https://github.com/lgblgblgb/xemu)
2. [Dev Kit](https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/Products/MEGA65/)

## Download Xemu

Let's begin by downloading Xemu using the steps below:

1. Visit the [Xemu page](https://github.lgb.hu/xemu/). On this blueish page, you will find two headings; *The 'future next stable' still unstable ("next" branch) builds* and *MEGA65/VIC-IV emulation enhancements ("merger" branch) builds*.
2. Scroll down to the *MEGA65/VIC-IV emulation enhancements ("merger" branch) builds* header.
3. Click the *‚ÄåMacOS DMG file* option to download the `Xemu-Installer.dmg` file.

    > M1 Mac users will note that the Mac Xemu build, as of this writing, is for Intel processors; however, Rosetta on the M1 will run Xemu and likely run it faster!

4. Locate the download (likely in your *Downloads* folder).
5. Double-click the `Xemu-Installer.dmg` file to mount the disk image and display the *GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE* window.
6. Click the *Agree* button.

## Install Xemu



## Configure Xemu
