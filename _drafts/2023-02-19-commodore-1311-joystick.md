You may have noticed my recent logo change. Well, it turns out that the joystick I used was too similar to Atari's original joystick design and that Atari still maintains their intellectual license to this design. How do I know? Because SpreadShop recently declined my request to print mugs and other swag with my logo! I know how much all all want my swag so I began a quest to change my logo and in the process, research the storied history of the Commodore 1311 joystick. You'll learn how these two things clashed in this blog post.

## My Logo Journey

SpreadShop told me the Atari Joystick is still the intellectual property of Atari.

Here's the January 30th, 2023 email from Spreadshop:

## Commodore's Storied Joystick History


### Legal Troubles

On October 11, 1982 Atari Patent attorney Michael Sheppard filed suit against Commodore for patent infringement. Atari claimed Commodore's joystick design was an exact copy of the Atari design. And on November 9th, [the following appeared](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/09/business/atari-gains-in-patent-case.html) in the New York Times:

> Atari Inc. said it had won a temporary injunction against Commodore Business Machines that prevents Commodore from making and selling joystick controllers for video games and home computers that are imitations of the one made by Atari. The ruling affects the joystick made by Commodore for its popular VIC-20 home computer.
> 
> Joysticks are the hand-held box used to operate video games.
> 
>A preliminary injunction was granted by Judge Richard Owen in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. A Commodore spokesman, reached at the company's offices in Pennsylvania, said company officials were returning from the annual meeting in New York and thus were not available for comment. The injunction may not pose much threat to VIC-20 sales, however, because that computer can use the Atari joysticks for game playing.
>
>Atari, the leading maker of home video games, filed suit Oct. 11, contending that the Commodore joystick infringed on its patents. Atari said the Commodore joystick looked like the Atari product except for the color, yet had some flaws that would cause it to break prematurely. Atari said it did not want customers to associate the broken joysticks with Atari.
