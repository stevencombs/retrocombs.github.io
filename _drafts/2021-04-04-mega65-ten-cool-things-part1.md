## Introduction

[The C64 maxi/mini](https://amzn.to/3gqCNUW) and The VIC20 devices are wonderful Commodore computer revivals; however, these devices focus on software emulation with either a keyboard, USB joystick, or USB drive as the only hardware device options.

What if you want an original Commodore computing experience that includes a Commodore specific keyboard, cartridge support, IEC devices, original game controllers, and mice? You might think the only option is to search eBay for a "working" used original Commodore computer. I recommend you wait. You may have the opportunity to purchase a new, in original box, [MEGA65](https://mega65.org/). This is the device you want.

I'm one of the lucky 100 (#00261 to be exact) [MEGA65 DevKit][625e0d3b] owners and while I'm not a developer, I chose to use my DevKit to help spread the word about what will be the Commodore retro-creation you will want to own. With an impending release announcement, I want to get everyone excited about MEGA65. Here's my list of the top 10 cool things you will be able to do on the MEGA65 that distinguish this device from other Commodore recreations such as THEC64 or software emulator [VICE - The Versatile Commodore Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io).

Before we look at the top 10, let's take a quick look at what makes the MEGA65 special.

## The MEGA65

The MEGA65 is the recreation of an unreleased prototype Commodore computer, the Commodore 65. The history of the Commodore 65 is an interesting read and I encourage you to review the [Wikipedia page on the computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_65).

According to the Wikipedia entry, the Commodore 65:

> (also known as the C64DX) is a prototype computer created at Commodore Business Machines in 1990–1991. It is an improved version of the Commodore 64, and it was meant to be backwards-compatible with the older computer, while still providing a number of advanced features close to those of the Amiga.

According to the MEGA65 web page, the MEGA65 is:

> the 21st century realization of the C65 heritage: a complete 8-bit computer running around 40x faster than a C64 while being highly compatible. C65 design, mechanical keyboard, HD output, SD card support, ethernet, extended memory and other features increase the fun without spoiling the 8-bit feel. Hardware designs and software are open-source (LGPL)

Instead of a chip-by-chip hardware recreation, the MEGA uses the an FPGA, or Field-programmable Gate Array, to "emulate" physical hardware. This FPGA allows the MEGA65 to receive regular "core" updates, and as I will show later, provide functionality not available on the original C65.

There's much more to learn about the history of the Commodore 65 and it's modern recreation, the MEGA65; however, that's not for this post. This post highlights the top 10 cool things you will be able to do with the MEGA65 when it is released.

## Top 10 Cool Things (1 through 5)

Let's dive into the top 10 things you will be able to do with the MEGA65.

### 1. Use an enhanced Commodore-layout keyboard

Throughout this video, I use the MEGA65 DevKit, which includes a wonderful mechanical keyboard. This is a similar keyboard to the one that the MEGA65 will include. Mechanical keyboards are all the rage and because of their popularity are more affordable; however, in the 1980s, full mechanical switch keyboards came on expensive \[ _cough_ \] IBM and IBM-clone business computers. Original Commodore keyboards were plunger-based. They weren't bad, especially when compared to chiclet keyboards popular on other budget 8-bit computers, and were relatively rugged. I don't remember ever having an issue with my Commodore VIC-20 or 128 keyboards and I was a HEAVY user. Still, there's room for a modern improvement to this old classic keyboard design.

The MEGA65 will include a [cherryMX™](https://www.cherrymx.de/en) keyboard with metal frame that includes the original PETSCII characters, colors, and functions printed right on the top and front of the keys. Using the keys is a joy during BASIC programming sessions. And these keys are not single stamped, but double-stamped for clarity and durability. This keyboard is built for the long haul and I'm looking forward to many years of use.

### 2. Play C65 games that "could have been"

It is hard to imagine that an 8-bit computer can rival the graphics and gameplay of the original Commodore Amiga; however, the MEGA65 will emulate the original hardware specification of the Commodore 65 and include in emulation:

* A 65CE02 (a MOS 6502 derivative) running at 3.54 MHz clock frequency
* A VIC-III graphics chip named the CSG 4567 capable of producing 256 colors from a palette of 4096 colors that produces available 320×200×256 (8), 640×200×16 (4), 640×400×16 (4), 1280×200×4 (2), and 1280×400×4(2) modes
* Supports all VIC-II video modes
* Text mode with 40/80 × 25 characters
* Synchronization with external video source (genlock)
* Integrated DMA controller (bit blit)
* Two CSG 8580R5 SID sound chips to produce stereo sound
* Separate left/right volume/filter/modulation controls
* 128 KB RAM, expandable to 1 MB
* 128 KB ROM

The Commodore C65 was a huge performance upgrade to the C64 or even it's more advanced, capable, and final Commodore 8-bit sibling, the C128. With these enhanced features, we should expect some "next-level" 8-bit games and developers for the MEGA65 are not going to let us down.

Along with the whole collection of Commodore 64 games, the MEGA65 will also allow you to play C65 titles. Here are few in-development games to show off the features of the MEGA65:

1.  Demo "proof of concept" maze game - Included with the demo SD card.
1.  [Luma](https://files.mega65.org?id=818034ec-a857-4fed-893a-99f836c63c1b) - Puzzle game
2.  [Turrican Engine Demo](https://files.mega65.org?id=d0cd9fcf-b1f0-4bd5-ac10-caf2e6f3e324)
2.  [The Job](https://files.mega65.org?id=615301eb-be89-4cf1-a109-79c8ae03dcaf) - An 80s inspired text adventure
3.  [Kalle Kloakk 65](https://files.mega65.org?id=d5a875c2-a8c5-4f3e-b196-363f4c9e2bed)
4.  [Revolution](https://files.mega65.org?id=009160ac-afa3-4014-a4a5-718af569d558)
5.  [Smashout](https://files.mega65.org?id=c1c39174-8522-4cd0-8d07-11f928dc67a7)
6.  [Char-Wars 65](https://files.mega65.org?id=f20e5f72-2593-4915-b5d5-66c437b71cc9)
7.  [M3wP Solitaire](https://files.mega65.org?id=693fa82c-ef25-483d-a221-a303a6e6229f)

Although MEGA65 titles are in early development, they are promising and as developers dive into the capabilities of the MEGA, the games are sure to highlight what could have been in the early 1990s had the C65 gone beyond prototype.

### 3. Use C64 Cartridges (Are C65 carts on their way?)

While we wait for MEGA65 game titles, we can use the collection of Commodore 64 game cartridges since the MEGA65 includes a C64 mode. Unlike TheC64 mini or maxi, the MEGA65 includes a cartridge port. When you insert a C64 cartridge into the MEGA65, it will boot straight to C64 mode and load the title as you can see in these demonstrations.

With my early release DevKit, most games work; however, some utilities cartridges, such as the Epix FastLoad aren't supported. The developers are aware that C64 emulation is incomplete; however, they remain committed to compatibility and also support the creation of a dedicated C64 core (more on this later); both of which will increase C64 compatibility.

> Huge thanks to [@slofunk, aka Jamie](https://twitter.com/slofunk?s=21) for the opportunity to test a few of his cartridges on my MEGA65 DevKit. Some neighbors borrow lawnmowers, from my neighbor, I borrow retro-computing gear!

Not everything works right now; such as this disk enhancement cartridge; however, the developers have this on their list of things to do and when a C64 core is released, compatibility will likely be better. The most compatible carts are games. Not a bad place to start!

Can we expect C65 compatible cartridges. Maybe; however, it will likely be a homebrew project. By default, the MEGA65 includes SD card and `.D81` image file support. Unless you want the true, insert cartridge and boot experience, there's really no reason to ship software on cartridge. I do hope some industrious developer will ship a title on cartridge, in a box, with instruction manuals and supplemental bonus materials. That's the true retro-experience I'd like to have once again.

### 4. Learn to program (BASIC 10 and Eleven)

The joy of owning a computer in the 1980s was learning BASIC. You had to if you wanted your computer to do anything. For me, it was a few months later before I could afford to purchase a Commodore Datasette for my Commodore VIC-20. Even then, it was not easy to find software since I lived an hour away from the closest metropolitan area. My option was to get a subscription to COMPUTE! and RUN magazines. Each month their arrival would include BASIC programs ready to type, save and use. While typing in programs, you learned about BASIC programming commands and logic.

Luckily, the MEGA65 comes with a huge upgrade to Commodore's original BASIC version 1.0 and includes an updated version 10 with commands from BASIC 3.5 found on the Commodore Plus/4 and version 7 found on the Commodore 128. Be sure to check out my [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual series](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4) to see the new BASIC commands not included with the VIC-20 or C64.

BASIC is great; however, in development is a wonderful MEGA65 mode development environment called Eleven. With Eleven you can develop games and software using an enhanced BASIC structure (no line numbers) and then compile the software. Add  Eleven to the power of the MEGA65 and you have a powerful and convenient on device development environment. I can't wait to dive into Eleven for my next BASIC programming project.

### 5. Use a wired/wireless USB mouse or Joystick

Unfortunately, input devices from the 1980s were not built to last and finding devices that work can be a futile or expensive proposition. Luckily, there are many manufacturers of retro-style joysticks; however, to my knowledge, no one makes a modern recreation of a Commodore 1351 mouse. Luckily, we live in a world where microcontrollers are a dime a dozen and tinkerers create amazing things such as the mouSTer from [retrohax.net](https://retrohax.net). What's a mouSTer? It's a device that allows the use of modern USB joysticks and mice on Atari and Commodore retro-computers. See [my full mouSTer video](https://youtu.be/OdPSfqBS5S8) for more information.

This device works with a modern USB joystick as I demonstrate in the video. In order to use with a Joystick, you will need to reconfigure the mouSTer. You can find out more on my [mouSTer blog][8edbc695] post.

  [8edbc695]: https://www.stevencombs.com/mouster-1 "retroCombs: Retrohax.net mouSTer on the MEGA65"

Earlier I showed you the game Solitaire. This software was designed to work with the 1351 mouse and as you can see in the video, the mouSTer and my [wireless Victsing mouse][5a0c6c18], work perfectly.

  [5a0c6c18]: https://www.stevencombs.com/victsing-wireless-mouse "OPEN THE BOX and FIRST USE: VictSing Wireless (USB and Bluetooth) Mouse"

There were many titles for the Commodore 64 and 128 that used the 1351 mouse; however, there was one title where this mouse was a requirement.

## Part 1 Conclusion

That's it for part 1 of this mini MEGA65 series. Come back for part two to find out what other cool things you will be able to do with a MEGA65 when I cover numbers 6 through 10. I might even include a bonus or two!
