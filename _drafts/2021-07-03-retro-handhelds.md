During Amazon Prime day 2021, the lure into the world of handheld game consoles drew me in. I use a RetroFlag RPi Case for handheld retro-gaming and enjoyed the process of assembly and configuration. You can see this process on my [Install Super RetroPie on the Retroflag GPi Case](https://www.stevencombs.com/gpicase) blog post and companion video. It is a great unit when paired with the [Super RetroPie distribution](https://mega.nz/folder/Ai5inYJa#mR2BXoPX9jnVCn42jqRjIQ).

I wanted to try something different; one of the many available out-of-the-box handheld retro-gaming experiences. During Amazon Prime day, these handheld units ranged in price from $10 to $50. I had affiliate funds (thanks to my supporters!!!) available, threw caution to the wind, and made the decision to purchase a couple of units.

In this continually updated blog post, I will share each system and include a [FAST LOAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA9RpEtS2f0&list=PLRVBh2hjFTolGfMsXnVa5rGN_f7YaL44n) companion video. Bookmark this page and come back regularly as I work my way through this series and add systems. It should be fun as I discover the capabilities and quirks of these handheld units.

## Introduction

To begin this page and series, I chose four different handheld units that ranged in price from $10 to $50. I had ‚âà$120 of affiliate funds that became my budget for this experiment. Selecting which models to purchase was difficult. Variety was a concern. There appear to be 100s of options with varying configurations. Many units are identical hardware with different seller branding.

I chose models with game counts from 500+ to unlimited (like the GPi Case). After hours of page swapping throughout the Amazon Prime 24 hour period, I chose the following models to purchase and compare to the [RetroFlag GPi Case](https://amzn.to/3Au3f9A):

Each unit has unique features and I found it difficult to compare them without a table. I created this table in Google Sheets.

I will not duplicate the table data for each handheld unit in their associated sections below. Those areas are my individual thoughts, experiences, and recommendations.

I will add to this table and when I do, I will update this blog post that will become a landing page for my retro-gaming handheld experiences. Before I open the first unit, below is the unit I will use to benchmark all other retro-gaming hand held units.

## RetroFlag GPi Case with RPi Zero W

I purchased this unit in January of 2020 at the height of COVID. It was a project to take my mind off the world. I fired up YouTube Live and shared the process with a couple of viewers (my subscriber count was around 500 then). Later I made an edit of the live video. You can view it below.

If I look back, it was this project and video that reinvigorated my interest in retro-computing and gaming and look at me now! 1700 of you find time to watch a video or two. Thank you!!!

### Unique Features

The GPi Case includes these unique features:

- Gameboy form factor and controls
- Raspberry Pi Zero powered (PiZero installs in cartridge and plugs into unit)
- Uses 3 AA batteries - I use recharables
- Includes shoulder buttons
- Supports the Super RetroBoy distribution, but you can use others
- Emulates any 1980s game system, including 8-bit computers
- IPS screen
- Holds THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of games on a single SD Card

The unique feature listed first is the Gameboy form factor. This is common with many handheld systems. Problem is, I am not a fan of that form factor. Since the original GameBoy, The shape of the unit and the controller placement made my hands and fingers hurt. For casual games, the layout is okay; however for action games it is a horribly frustrating and painful experience. I suspect that other systems that use this form factor will not be different.

### Final Thoughts

As of this writing, this is the pinnacle of retro-gaming handheld gamine goodness. Not for the form factor, as I mention earlier in the article, but for the sheer number of possible configuration and game system compatibility.

This is the only unit I consider a true retro-gaming experience because it is the only system in my list that can emulate Atari, Commodore, ZX Spectrum, and other retro-computing computers from the 1980s. Other units on my list begin with the NES, and while technically those are 8-bit and worthy of their retro title, that excludes a whole inventory of amazing games. Not one of them emulates an Atari 2600: Unacceptable!

Using a Raspberry Pi Zero for hardware in the GPi Case is genius. As long as there are no major changes to the RPi Zero's shape and connector locations, we will be able to continually update the hardware in our GPi case for ‚âà$25. No other unit on this page has that capability.

The RPi Zero emulation software receives continual updates to security, features, and emulators. This device is the benchmark for other handheld retro-gaming platform even though I would prefer a [Playstation PSP](https://amzn.to/3hvF1Tu) or [Nintendo Switch](https://amzn.to/3xfkk52) form factor.
