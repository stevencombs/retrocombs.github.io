I'm an original Atari 2600 user. This wasn't my first video game system. That distinction goes to the original Pong console in the mid-1970s; however, it is the Atari 2600 I remember more fondly and as an impressionable young man of 13, this device would change my after school world.

Our family was one of the first in our community to purchase the console in 1978. We drove over an hour on a Saturday to visit a Sears department store where we purchased the Sears Video Arcade (Tele-Games) branded Atari 2600 and two games. I remember laboring with my Step Father over which two games to purchase. I choose Space Invaders, and he chose Basketball. The hour drive back was one of the longest of my life.

Once we got home with the console, I connected it to our living room television set. Even then, I was gadget geek. We gamed for hours over the weekend only taking breaks for meals and church. Before we knew it, the weekend was over and it was back to school and work on Monday. After school, I returned home to practice Basketball before my step-father returned from work. After dinner, fierce virtual NCAA games would commence.

It is important to note that Atari 2600 ownership was a pricey proposition for our middle-class family. The console coast $199 (about $800 in today's money). Cost of ownership increased as we added (or replaced) joystick controllers, paddle controllers, and the following cartridges (that I can remember):

* Adventure - The classic, move around and look for things, game
* Atlantis - An Imagic missile command clone that is far superior to even the arcade version
* Basic Programming (with Keypads) - Yes, you could actually do basic programming and the keypads could be used with other titles
* Basketball - I was the king in my home and broke many a joystick with this game.
* Boxing - I didn't like this one because I was the worst in our home and was often beaten by my Step-Father and siblings
* Chopper Command -
* Cosmic Ark -
* Demon Attack -
* Donkey Kong - An arcade port for the 2600 that didn't stink
* Haunted House - Similar to Adventure but with some scary 8-bit characters
* H.E.R.O. - A man flying with a backpack is all it took for me to want this game
* Pac Man - Everyone had this horrible version of the classic arcade game
* Pitfall - Hours, and hours, and hours jumping over crocodile heads and logs
* River Raid - Second only to Pitfall for joystick time
* Space Invaders - I believe we purchased this one with the console but I was never a fan of the arcade game so not sure why we did
* Spider Fighter - Out of control action and not for those with a fear of arachnids
* Star Master - As a Star Trek fan, I thought this would be similar (It was not!)
* Yars Revenge - Another Atari 2600 classic that was just too much fun
* Zaxxon - My favorite arcade game of all time and this port was the worst

As the console aged, many of the games in the list above came into our home at discount prices. This list should be longer; however, I've since forgotten some cartridges because they were so bad, I rarely played them. The one saving grace though is that we never did purchase the E.T. game which was so bad, they [buried all the unsold copies in a landfill](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/documentary-explores-atari-s-downfall-dumping-of-et-game-at-landfill-1.2310755).

There were some real bright spots though. Two brands stood above the rest; Imagic and Activision. Their games were far superior to Atari and I saved money from my summer mowing job and waited with baited for their cartridges. In much the same vain as owning an album with liner notes, I would select games by box art â€¦

I continued to play the Atari 2600 through the early 1980s. The console lost favor in 1981 when I purchased my first home computer, the Commodore VIC-20. The VIC-20 took me from being a player to programming my own games. And that's a whole other story for another blog post. Suffice it to say, without the Atari 2600, I would not have continued my love of home computers.

I'm going to relive these days with a new Hyperkin RetroN 77.
