<!-- Ugh! Where is that dang Freeze Frame command? -->

DaVinci Resolve is my goto video editing software but I'm often frustrated with the complex and expansive command set. There's no denying, the cost is excellent (free or $300 for a lifetime licensed version) and there's a huge base of users who share tips and tricks to make learning the software easier, like one of my favorites, [MrAlexTech](https://www.youtube.com/MrAlexTech). But despite Alex's fine presentation of tips and tricks, I always find myself asking, now where is that freeze frame command (or insert any other command)? But I've found my solution!

<!-- Show me using Paletor briefly to locate the Freeze Frame command -->

It's time for me to share another tool I use to create my retro-computing content.

## The Command Palette

Obsidian, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio Code users power their way through these apps using a command palette. In both programs, the command palette activates when you hit a shortcut similar to `‚áß` + `‚åò` + `p`. When the palette displays, the user types the first few letters of a command the command reveals available software options. The command palette is unique to specific software; unless you are a Mac user.

## Paletor

While listening to the [Mac Power User's podcast](https://www.relay.fm/mpu), the guys mentioned the software [Paletor](https://appmakes.io/paletro), a $7 Mac OS X application and available on [SetApp](https://setapp.com/)). Paletor provides command palette access to every Mac application, they promised. 

I was intrigued, researched the app, and said, "this would be awesome with DaVinci Resolve." Why DaVinci Resolve? Because that software is inundated with commands in the pull-down menus and I can NEVER remember where things are located or their keyboard shortcuts.

## Paletor with DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci Resolve does not include a command palette. It does include a help function that searches available commands, but you need to mouse up to the menu select it and then type the name of the command. With Paletor, I activate the app, type a few letters, and BOOM! 

Let me show you you how it works with these ten examples that supercharge my workflow:

1. Freeze Frame - `freeze`
2. Dual Display Views - `dual`
3. Create a new Timeline - `new tim`
4. Media Page - `media`
5. Deliver Page - `del`
5. Edit Page - `edit`
6. Fairlight Page - `fair`
7. New Timeline - `timel`
8. Inspector On/Off - `in`
9. Split Clip - `spl`
10. Effects - `eff`

This is a small sampling of the power of pull-down menu access using Paletor. Prior to Paletor, I would use the mouse. Sure DaVinci Resolve includes keyboard shortcuts, but Paletor simplifies and reveals commands.

Here's one last use case example. Let's say you know there's a command in the *Edit* menu but you can't remember the name. Paletor can reveal it:

1. Activate Paletor with `‚áß` + `‚åò` + `p`.
2. Type `edit` and an arrow will appear next to the word.
3. Hit `‚Üπ` or `‚Üí` and Paletor will display the commands in that menu.
4. Type a few letters to limit the options further.

## Additional Paletor Information

Paletor works with DaVinci Resolve but it is important to note that this software works with any Mac OS software. If a title includes its own command palette, Paletor has a preference option to deactivate.

Speaking of preferences, here are a few others:

1. Start on Login
2. Show current app icon on left
3. Show options on right
4. Set the number of items to display
5. Change the theme (install themes coming soon)
6. Change the hotkey (but why?)
7. Exclude apps
8. Exclude menu or menu items
7. Install extensions (haven't seen any yet)

Paletor is valuable for content creator on a Mac beyond video editing. For instance, I do all my writing in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), which does not include a command palette, and I have several keyboard shortcuts in my muscle memory but for the commands that I don't have memorized, Paletor discovers them to make learning the app faster and using the app easier.
