retroCombs: Today, we'll be talking about the first batch of Commodore branded joysticks. It is an interesting journey filled with intrigue and controversy and we’ll start with the VIC-1311 model.

First, a huge shout-out to Bil Herd who let me ping him with questions and the International Commodore Historical Society who helped with the narrative and visual content of this video. I’ll do my best to place proper attribution but if I do forget someone, please correct me in the comments below.

Our story begins in 1981 with the release of the Commodore Business Machines Model VIC-1311 Joystick. was designed by Tom Palecki and was intended for use with the Commodore VIC-20. Its design was similar to the Atari 2600 joystick, which Atari believed to be a copyright infringement.

Atari filed a lawsuit against Commodore, stating that the VIC-1311 was a "blatant copy" of their joystick. The case was filed in San Francisco on August 20, 1982, and resulted in Commodore discontinuing the original VIC-1311 joystick. Atari won the lawsuit and was awarded damages. And here’s my own personal story with the original Atari design.

If you’ve followed along recently, you know that my logo changed. Here’s my original logo.

I was quite pleased with it and it was doing what is was designed to do, provide a visual indicator about what my channel and blog is about. I mixed an Atari joystick inspired design (highlighting 80s gaming) with the colors from the Commodore Plus/4 (my first foray into regular YouTube content) to create a colorful icon of my brand. However, while recently deciding to create a brand store, SpreadShop told me they could not print my logo because Atari still held the intellectual rights to their joystick design. This led me down a rabbit hole of research only to discover the first Commodore model joystick, the VIC-1311, which was heavily inspired, or as I now know, stolen from Atari. How did they get away with this. The answer is, they didn’t. And they ended up with another design which we’ll talk about now. Oh, don’t worry, more about my logo journey later too.

Back to Commodore joystick journey, after the lawsuit, their designers went back to the drawing board and created a new new joystick model, the 1311 (removing the VIC- moniker). This new design was original and fresh and a significant enough departure from the Atari-inspired design to keep Atari’s lawyer at bay.

This new design has a rectangular base, a prism shaped handle, and a single button moved to the top middle of the base. In speaking with those who have used the joystick and from my own personal experience with a model I purchased from eBay, the common theme is this joystick causes more pain to the hand than it controls characters on the screen. Still, it is lauded for a great design and I personally love it! Which leads me to...I figured if this design was good enough to keep Atari from suing the pants off Commodore, it would likely work for my logo since Commodore is no longer in business and to the best of my knowledge, no one is claiming the intellectual design of this joystick in 2023. As many in my Discord pointed out, this joystick better represents my Commodore focused channel and blog.

The 1311 was compatible with both the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64. It measured 10 cm x 14 cm x 2.5 cm, had a 2-meter cord, and cost $19.95.

The Commodore joystick designed for the Commodore Plus/4 and C16 used a different type of connector than the industry-standard DB-9 or the original 1311 joystick. It measured 10 cm x 14 cm x 2.5 cm, had a 1-meter cord, and cost $14.95.

Popular games such as Defender of the Crown, Raid on Bungeling Bay, and The Last Ninja were responsible for the sales and popularity of Commodore joysticks. Commodore sold over 2 million joysticks in total, promoting computers as not only business machines but also game machines.

Interestingly, Atari and Commodore had more connections than just the joystick controversy. There was movement of employees and leaders between the two companies.

[Cut to image of third-party joysticks]

Other popular third-party brands of joysticks for early computers included Quickshot, Wico, and Suncom. These joysticks differed from Commodore's or Atari's branded joysticks in terms of design and cost.

Today, we're going to be talking about one of the most important accessories for home computers of the 1980s - the joystick.

[Cut to various shots of different joystick models]

Host: While joysticks had been around for a few years prior, it wasn't until the 1980s that they really took off, thanks in part to the rise of home computers and video gaming. And when it comes to joysticks for home computers, two companies stands out - Commodore and Atari. This is their joystick story.

[Cut to image of a Commodore VIC-20 computer]

Host: Commodore was a major player in the home computer market in the early 1980s, with popular models such as the VIC-20 (my first computer) and the amazingly popular Commodore 64. And like many computer manufacturers of the time, they needed a joystick so user could play games. While it has been impossible for me to find out who the industrial designers were, Commodore Business Machines produced their own line of joysticks beginning with the VIC-1311.

[Cut to image of a VIC-1311 joystick]

This joystick was designed for use with the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 computers and had a simple four-directional stick and a single button. The design inspiration for this joystick looks strangely familiar. Do you see it?


Host: However, Commodore's success with their joysticks was not without controversy. In the mid-1980s, Atari filed a lawsuit against Commodore, alleging that the design of Commodore's joysticks infringed on Atari's joystick design patents. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, with Commodore agreeing to pay Atari a licensing fee for the use of their joystick designs.

[Cut to image of a joystick being designed on a computer]

Host: While the specific designers of Commodore's joysticks are not well documented, it's clear that these accessories played an important role in the success of their computers. Joysticks were often the primary input device for video games on home computers, and Commodore's joysticks helped to popularize gaming in the home computer market.

[Cut to various shots of different joystick models]

Host: Whether you were using a VIC-1311, a QuickShot II, or a Wico Command Control, Commodore's joysticks were a key part of the home computer

Host: Hello and welcome to retroCombs, where we take a nostalgic look back at the technology of the past. Today, we're going to be talking about one of the most important accessories for home computers of the 1980s - the joystick.

[Cut to image of an Atari joystick]

Host: In the mid-1980s, Atari filed a lawsuit against Commodore, alleging that the design of Commodore's joysticks infringed on Atari's joystick design patents. Atari had been one of the pioneers in the video game industry, and they had developed a number of joystick designs that were patented and trademarked.

[Cut to images of various Atari joystick designs]

Host: Some of Atari's most iconic joystick designs included the CX10, the CX40, and the CX78. These designs featured distinctive button and stick layouts, and Atari claimed that Commodore had copied these designs without permission.

[Cut to image of a joystick being designed on a computer]

Host: The lawsuit was a major blow to Commodore, which had been enjoying success with its line of home computers and joysticks. The case dragged on for several years, with both sides presenting evidence and arguments in court.

[Cut to image of an Atari logo]

Host: In the end, the two companies reached a settlement out of court. Commodore agreed to pay Atari a licensing fee for the use of its joystick designs, and the lawsuit was dropped.

[Cut to image of a Commodore 64 computer with a joystick connected]

Host: Despite the setback, Commodore continued to produce high-quality joysticks for its computers. The VIC-1311 and QuickShot II were popular models, and the Wico Command Control joystick was highly sought after by serious gamers.

[Cut to image of a Wico Command Control joystick]

Host: Today, the legacy of the Commodore and Atari joystick lawsuit lives on. The case set an important precedent for the video game industry, establishing that joystick designs could be protected by patents and trademarks.

[Cut to image of a patent document]

Host: It also serves as a reminder of the importance of innovation and originality in the technology industry.

[Closing shot of a Commodore 64 computer with a joystick connected]

Host: Thanks for joining us on this trip down memory lane. Join us next time for more retroCombs, where we'll explore more of the technology that shaped our world.


[Cut to image of a QuickShot II joystick]

Host: However, Commodore was not the only company producing joysticks for their computers. Third-party manufacturers such as QuickShot and Wico also produced high-quality joysticks that were compatible with Commodore computers. The QuickShot II joystick, for example, featured a distinctive red and black color scheme and two buttons, making it suitable for use with games that required more complex controls.

[Cut to image of a Wico Command Control joystick]

Host: The Wico Command Control joystick, on the other hand, was a high-end accessory designed for serious gamers. It had a unique "trigger stick" design that allowed for precise control in all directions, as well as a large fire button and a separate button for autofire. The Wico joystick was one of the most expensive joysticks on the market at the time, but was highly sought after by enthusiasts.

[Cut to image of an Amiga Power Stick joystick]

Host: As Commodore continued to release new computer models, they also developed new joystick models to go along with them. The Amiga Power Stick, for example, was designed for use with the Commodore Amiga computer and featured a detachable cable and a more ergonomic shape.
