As followers of this blog and my YouTube channel know, I love to work my way through user's manuals and and share my discoveries in video. In this post, I continue my [MEGA 65 series](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-1) as I work through the MEGA 65 Starter Guide.

## Starter Guide


## YouTube Video: _retroCombs: MEGA 65 Starter Guide_

## Key to Keys

Because the MEGA 65 keyboard layout is different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key    | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----|:------------|
| `⇪`    | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `|M|` | MEGA     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `⌃`    | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `⎋`    | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `⌂`    | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `⌫`    | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `⏎`    | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `⇧`    | Shift         | `␣`  | Space       |
| `↑`    | Cursor Up     | `↓`  | Cursor Down |
| `→`    | Cursor Right  | `←`  | Cursor Left |
