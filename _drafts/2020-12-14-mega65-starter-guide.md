As followers of this blog and my YouTube channel know, I love to work my way through user's manuals and and share my discoveries in video. In this post, I continue my [ series](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-1) as I work through the  Starter Guide.

## Starter Guide


## YouTube Video: _retroCombs:  Starter Guide_

## Key to Keys

Because the  keyboard layout is different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key    | Description   | Key  | Description |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----|:------------|
| `‚á™`    | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |
| `|M|` | MEGA     | `F2` | Function 2  |
| `‚åÉ`    | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |
| `‚éã`    | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |
| `‚åÇ`    | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |
| `‚å´`    | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |
| `‚èé`    | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |
| `‚áß`    | Shift         | `‚ê£`  | Space       |
| `‚Üë`    | Cursor Up     | `‚Üì`  | Cursor Down |
| `‚Üí`    | Cursor Right  | `‚Üê`  | Cursor Left |
