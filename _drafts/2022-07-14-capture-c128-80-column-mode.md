A box arrived on my doorstep and that means a new Commodore related livestream! In a [Chuck Hutchins, Jr.](https://twitter.com/hutchca?s=21&t=spGoWLQ34fc_VXmiFFjx0A) video, [HDMI for the Commodore PET](https://youtu.be/lfhs8HLsFAg), Chuck shared the how he used the [texElec](https://texelec.com/) [RGB2HDMI](https://texelec.com/product/rgbtohdmi-ttl/) to add HDMI out on his original Commodore 2001 Series PET.

I was fascinated with the operation of this device and asked Chuck on Twitter if it worked with the Commodore 128. He tweeted an affirmative with an image. I was intrigued, went to the site to make a purchase but found they were out of stock. Rats. A couple of weeks later, Chuck pinged me to let me know [a version know as RGBtoHDMI](https://retrohackshack.com/product/rgbtohdmi/) was in stock at [Retro Hack Shack](https://retrohackshack.com). I raced to the site place the order and about 10 days later, the box landed on my doorstep. Unlike the texElec version, I will source my own Raspberry Pi Zero.

In this livestream and companion blog post, I setup the RGBtoHDMI on my Commodore 128 to capture and share the C128's 80-column mode. A mode this is all too often overlooked.

## About the RGB2HDMI

What is the RGBtoHDMI device? Here's a blurb from [the device wiki](https://github.com/hoglet67/RGBtoHDMI/wiki):

> The RGBtoHDMI interface converts the "digital" RGB video signal from vintage computers like the BBC Micro or PC MDA/CGA/EGA to HDMI or DVI compatible with most modern TVs/Monitors. The interface comprises a Raspberry Pi Zero and a specially designed Hat containing a small CPLD. Custom firmware on the Raspberry Pi, in conjunction with the CPLD, is able to correctly sample each of the supported video modes to give a pixel-perfect rendition.

The [device support list](https://github.com/hoglet67/RGBtoHDMI/wiki/Supported-Computers) is LONG but for this video and blog post, I'll focus its use with [my Commodore 128](/c128-1). Before we can use the device, we work ahead. Unlike the texElec version which comes complete with Raspberry Pi Zero, 9-pin video out, and a custom board, the Retro Hack Shack version is a Raspberry Pi Zero hat.
