First things first, TIPI is pronounced (per TI fans everywhere); "T.I. Pi" and and "Tippy." With that clarification out of the way, what is the TIPI for the Texas Instruments (TI) 99/4A? In this blog post and companion video, I discus, install, and use the TIPI for the first time on [the latest addition](/first-ti994a) to my retro computer collection.

## 32 Kb Sidecar Memory Expansion Installation

Follow the steps below to install the 32 Kb Sidecar Memory Expansion:

1. Plug into sidecar expansion slot on the TI 99/4A.
2. Plug in the provided power supply (list which one).

With the sidecar installed, we will use two ways to test the memory. One using BASIC and the other running a 32 Kb home-brew title using a FinalROM 99.

### Free Memory Available

To test the memory using TI Extended BASIC:

1. Plug-in a TI Extended BASIC cartridge (or a FLASHROM 99 with TI Extended BASIC `.ROM` image).
2. Type `SIZE` in BASIC and press `‚èé`. The BASIC interpreter will display the following:

    ```
    11840 BYTES OF STACK FREE
    24490 BYTES OF PROGRAM
       SPACE FREE
    ```
