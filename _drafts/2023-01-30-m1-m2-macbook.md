I always knew my M1 MacBook Pro (with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD) was a stop gap measure until more powerful Apple silicon was available and what I found was the M1 was far more powerful than I suspected but can be a pain with certain use cases. In this post, I'll share my journey from a 2020 13" M1 MacBook Pro to a 2023 14" M2 Max MacBook Pro with hopes that I can help others on the fence.

## Introduction

I want to be clear. My content will not cover benchmark data. This is a pure cosmetic and usability review. If you want full technical benchmarks there are many online and I'd recommend [this one from Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/23/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-m2-max-review/). And if we need to get the a general idea of the performance difference between these two computers, here's a highlighted graphic from their page:

![[geekbench-techcrunch.png]]

As shown in the graph above, the M2 Max ‚âà double the performance of the M1 in mult core operation, but in single core, only slightly. This makes me suspect that day-to-day performance will "feel" roughly the same, but when crunching video (one of my regular tasks), the M2 Max should "feel" much faster. We also have to remember that the maximum amount of RAM available was only 16GB. The M2 Max I own is 64GB. That too should make things "feel" much smoother. But enough of the "feels," let's find out by comparing the two visually.

## M1 MacBook Pro

Let's talk the M1 MacBook Pro. This model came hot on the heals of the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon. To get machines out the door, Apple slapped the silicon into the most recent MacBook Pro form factor that included a 13" screen, keyboard, trackpad, Touch Bar with Touch ID, and 720p video camera. The ports changed slightly but in the end an M1 MacBook Pro was ready to ship. But, there was a critical drawback.

The M1 had two memory options: 8 and 16GB. I spent the extra bucks and upgraded to 16Gb but skimped on the SSD at only 256GB. The price was right at $1200 and I've made the RAM/SSD limitations work; however, as I continue to create content for YouTube, I've noticed the limitations. But now I sure would like some RAM and SSD headroom and that brings me to my latest purcahse.

## M2 Max MacBook Pro

I choose to replace my M1 with a new 14" MacBook Pro with an M2 Max with the following specification followed by some comments:

- 1TB SSD storage - I'd been using a [SanDisk 2TB portable SSD](https://amzn.to/3wGzgud) on the M1
- Apple M2 Max with 12‚Äëcore CPU, 38‚Äëcore GPU, 16‚Äëcore Neural Engine - Wow! That's a lot more cores
- Three Thunderbolt¬†4 ports - 1 more than the M1
- HDMI port - No more carrying around a dongle to connect to video
- SDXC card slot - See note above about a dongle only this time for transfering content from camera to computer
- Headphone Jack - M1 had one too
- MagSafe¬†3 port - Handy, but I'll probably keep using the USB-C port to charge
- 64GB unified memory - Oh, yeah!
- Backlit Magic¬†Keyboard with Touch¬†ID - The M1 had both of these but I will miss the Touch Bar
- 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display - This sceen is amazing
- 96W USB-C Power Adapter - Always good to have an extra adapter

As I mentioned, the new MacBook Pros don't include the Touch Bar. I'm going to miss this feature. I know the Touch Bar is controversial; however, I loved it and when paired with BetterTouchTool, it helped me chew through tasks. On this new M2 MacBook Pro, it will seem like I'm going back in time and loosing some very cool tech. I'll adjust. I know this. But, man! It will be difficult.

All of this computer goodness comes at a cost of $3400 but Apple offered me $525 for the M1 trade-in. That seemed like a very good deal for a two year old computer so I added the trade-in kit to the cart.

## What We Have Learned So Far

Here's what we know so far:

1. The M2 Max costs almost three times more than the M1.
2. The Geekbench score shows a single core bench mark about the same between the M1 and M2 but twice the speed in multi-core use.
3. MacBook Pros hold their value fairly well.
4. The M2 returns pro features such as the SD card reader and HDMI port.
5. The M2 omits the Touch Bar.
6. The M2 is meant for Pros and the M1 was a MacBook Air with an extra battery, slightly better screen, an extra USB-C port, and a Touch Bar.

Now let's run some cosmetic and visual performance tests to compare the two devices.

## Comparisons

For these comparisons, I transfered my account from the M1 to the M2 using a USB-C cable and Apple's Migration Assistance. I also cleared the cache on the older M1 using [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html). I use `homebrew` to install this software. My hope was that doing these steps would make it a more even "apple" to "apple" comparison. Before I take a look at a performance comparision, let's compare hardware.

### Weight

M1 is 2.7lbs
M2 is 3.7lbs

## Size



### Form factor

Both are the typical clamshell laptop form factor; however, that's about where the comparison ends. I've already listed my MacBook Pro M2 Max configuration, but let me highlight key visible difference. 

And on a positive note, the sizes are close enough, but I get an extra inch of screen real estate, that the [folio case](link) I used for the M1 also works with the M2! It's just a bit tighter, but over time, the case will stretch to conform. 

### Screen

round corners at top of screen and a notch, which I thought would bother me.

## Usability

Now that we've looked at hardware, it is time to take a non scientific look at usability performance and I choose a few tasks to look at:

1. Boot up
2. Restart
3. DaVinci Resolve Startup/Render
4. Battery Life
5. Web Browser

I will plug in each MacBook Pro to ensure these laptops have the power they need to operate the Apple Silicon at full speed and using all cores.

### Boot Up



### Restart



### DaVinci Resolve Startup/Render

Startup times were not dissimilar for both computers. Nothing really save there; however, rendering is where you earn your bread and butter with a video editor and I performed two renderings. One on battery power only and another on power. I have both set to use low power settings when unplugged and everything firing with power plugged in. Here's how they faired.

### Battery

M1 = 
M2 Max =

### Power

M1 = 
M2 Max =

### Battery Life

To test the battery, I charged the batteries to 100%, set the two computers side-by-side, set their screens to 50% brightness,  volume to 50%, loaded one of my REALLY long livestreams, pressed play and let them run for 20 mins. Now there is an inherent problem with this test. First, the M1 has about 16 months of battery usage and the M2 is brand new; however, this is part of the value proposition. Was the M1 battery life degrading. If so, having a new laptop with a new battery does make things "feel better."

After an hour of video, here's how much battery life was left on each computer:

M1 = 99%
M2 Max = 100%

That's wasn't a very representative test, let's be clear, the M1 originally had a battery life rating of 16  hours and the M2 Max 12 hours. That's a four hour difference so if battery life is your main concern (it is not mine), the M2 Max is not the selection to make. 

After my test we can briefly see, I've lost some power with my older M1 and am likely to see some battery life gains with the new M2 Max, for now. Time will tell and since I use my laptop in power saving mode on battery power, I suspect I will get some battery life back.

### Web Browser


## Sound


## Webcam



## Conclusion

And the final verdict for me, your mileage may vary, is that I made the correct choice.
