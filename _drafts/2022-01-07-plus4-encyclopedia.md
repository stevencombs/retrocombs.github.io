With the last chapter complete, we now spend our time in the last half of the manual. You read that correctly, Chapters 1 through 8 take the first 100 pages, and the Plus/4 Encyclopedia occupies another 183 pages of the user's manual.

## Series Information

This episode is a small part of my larger Commodore Plus/4 series. You can read the entire series and view additional resources at:

## Companion Disk Image

As I progress through the user's manual, I enter and execute sample programs. The link below is to a `.D81` image that contains every program from each episode. **Like the series, the image is not complete.**

[retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image](/plus4/plus4-users-manual.d81)

I use the following file name convention to make it easy to locate specific programs:

<img src="https://www.stevencombs.com/images/design/floppy-disk-small.png" align="right">Sample Program Name: `02 RCOMBS SCROLL.PRG`

* `02` - The chapter number
* `RCOMBS SCROLL` - my self assigned name for the BASIC program which will be immediately identifiable if you follow along.

## User's Manual

As part of my Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 manual. I've taken the time to scan each chapter. Use the link below to view the Encyclopedia:

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I devised a modern key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

| Key     | Description   | Key  | Description |  
| :------ | :------------ | :--- | :---------- |  
| `‚á™`     | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1  |  
| `[C=]`  | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2  |  
| `‚åÉ`     | Control       | `F3` | Function 3  |  
| `‚éã`     | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4  |  
| `‚åÇ`     | Clear/Home    | `F5` | Function 5  |  
| `‚å´`     | Insert Delete | `F6` | Function 6  |  
| `‚èé`     | Return        | `F7` | Function 7  |  
| `[R/S]` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help        |  
| `‚áß`     | Shift         | `‚ê£`  | Space       |  
| `‚Üë`     | Cursor Up     | `‚Üì`  | Cursor Down |  
| `‚Üí`     | Cursor Right  | `‚Üê`  | Cursor Left |

## Encyclopedia Introduction

The Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual begins with chapters one through eight. The chapters comprise the first half of the manual with the Encyclopedia occupying the last half. In this blog post and companion video, I will not cover the Encyclopedia in its entirety but will share highlights each of the 14 sections. I encourage you to explore each section.

The Encyclopedia includes a mix of beginner and advanced topics. The most useful section for the beginner, and the longest section in the user's manual, is *Section 1: BASIC 3.5 Encyclopedia*. If you are new to Commodore BASIC or want to understand the upgraded commands that come with BASIC 3.5, review this section.

*Section 12: Programs to Try* includes BASIC code that explores concepts found in past chapters. I include them all on the [retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image](/plus4/plus4-users-manual.d81).

## Section 1: BASIC 3.5 Encyclopedia

The BASIC 3.5 Encyclopedia is 51 pages long and provides an alphabetical listing of all BASIC commands. Throughout this series, I have covered a majority of the commands and BASIC concepts; however, I will highlight those not covered or that deserve additional detail.

> **NOTE:** This section recommends the [Programmer's Reference Guide for the Commodore Plus 4 (1986)(Scott Foresman & Co)](https://archive.org/details/Programmers_Reference_Guide_for_the_Commodore_Plus_4_1986_Scott_Foresman_Co). Luckily, the Internet Archive has a copy to read online or download.

## Section 14: Books for Commodore Products

Several books are listed but what surprises me is that none of them are Commodore Plus/4 specific.

Here are links to other books that I recommend.

1. [Programmer's Reference Guide for the Commodore Plus 4 (1986)(Scott Foresman & Co)](https://archive.org/details/Programmers_Reference_Guide_for_the_Commodore_Plus_4_1986_Scott_Foresman_Co)

## Final Thoughts

1. The Encyclopedia‚Ä¶
2. That concludes my Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual series.
