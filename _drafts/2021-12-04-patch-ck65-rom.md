I've mention in several blog posts and videos that the closed ROM for the MEGA65 is available to purchasers of a [MEGA65](https://www.mega65.org) or [Dev Kit](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-1) and others must use the [open ROM](https://files.mega65.org?id=8aec2fba-3b0a-4677-80ae-7a7f5f4f0cb8); which is not yet ready for prime time. Since the open ROM needs to bake, using it means mixed results if you want to try the free [Xemu emulator](https://www.stevencombs.com/xemu-on-mac) or the less expensive [Nexys4 FPGA](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-nexys4-livestream). Let's make those experiences better. We can search and download the original Commodore 65 ROM and then patch that file with tools created by the MEGA65 team.

Before you read the rest of this post, take a look at my companion video below.

## Obtain Original C65 ROM

The original Commodore 65 was in prototype form in 1991. Meant to be the last of the 8-bit line for Commodore, this computer unfortunately never saw the light of day; however, those fortunate enough to obtain one of the prototypes, dumped the ROM files and shared them with the community and you can find them on [Zimmers.net](http://www.zimmers.net).

1. Open a browser and navigate to [Zimmers.Net C65 firmware archive](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/c65/index.html). There are several; however, we are looking for a specific ROM.
2. Scroll down to the `911001.BIN` file.
3. Click the link, in red, to download the file.
4. Make a copy of the file with the name `911001_archive.BIN` in case you need a copy of the original ROM file.
5. Place the `911001.BIN` file on your desktop or other easy to find location.

With an original ROM file on-hand, time to patch it and add the new features and functions of the MEGA65.

## Download Patch Tools

There are a couple of way to patch the original ROM; however, I'll share the easiest method that uses the GUI, M65 Connect. Since M65Connect is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows, everyone will be able to patch their ROMs. Let's get out copy of M65Connect.

1. Use a web browser and visit the MEGA65 FileHost at <https://files.mega65.org>.
2. Click the *Files* button in the upper-left corner of the page.
3. In the *File search‚Ä¶* box, type `M65Co` and a list of M65Connect versions will display.
4. Click the download button \|<u>‚Üì</u>\| in the row that matches the operating systems you use.
5. Install the application.

Now that we have an install of M65Connect, we are now ready to patch the original C65 ROM.

## Download the C65 ROM Diff File

1. Return back to the Files are of the FileHost in your browser.
2. In the *File search‚Ä¶* box, type `‚Äådiff files` and the ROM patch file named `C65 ROM diff files` will appear.
3. Click the download button \|<u>‚Üì</u>\| and save the diff file in the same location as the original C65 ROM file.

Let's patch the original ROM with the diff file.

> **NOTE:** If you click the diff file title on the FileHost additional information about the page k

## Patch ROM

M65Connect makes patching the original C65 ROM a point and click process.

1. Load the M65Connect application.
2. From the main menu, select *File* \| *Patch ROM File* and the Patch ROM file dialog box will appear as shown below:

    ![Patch ROM File dialog box](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/patch-rom-dialog.png)
    
3. Select the *Source ROM File* by clicking the folder button üìÅ to the right of the text box to display a file selection dialog box.
4. Navigate to the location of the original C65 ROM file named `911001.BIN` and select.
5. Select the *ROM Patch File* by clicking the folder button üìÅ to the right of the text box to display a file selection dialog box.
6. Navigate to the location of the diff file with a name similar to `920262.BDF` and select.
7. Verify the names in the text boxes are correct.
8. Click the *Save patched ROM as‚Ä¶* button and the *Save patched ROM file as‚Ä¶* dialog box will appear.
9. Save the file as `MEGA65.BIN` and press the *Save* button and the new file will be saved to the same location as the two original files.

The resultant `MEGA65.BIN` file is now ready to use.

## ROM file updates

Update the patched ROM when the MEGA65 team releases new diff files. There are three ways to do this:

1. Use the same steps found in the previous section to update the original ROM.
2. Use the same steps found in the previous section to update the recent patched ROM. 
3. **Coming Soon!** Copy the diff file to an SD Card and use the *Freezer* on a MEGA65 to patch the ROM file.

## Use Patched ROM

If you use a hardware device, rename `MEGA65.BIN` to `MEGA65.ROM`. These devices look for this file on the SD card.

### MEGA65 and Nexys4 FPGA

1. Rename `MEGA65.BIN` to `MEGA65.ROM`.
2. Copy the ROM file to the SD Card. Overwrite the existing ROM file or rename that file to retain a working copy if things go wrong.
3. Place the SD card into the MEGA65 or Nexys4.
4. Boot the device and the diff file name similar to (920262) will appear as the current ROM on the MEGA65 start screen as shown in the image below:

    ![Verify the ROM on the MEGA65 Start Screen](https://www.stevencombs.com/images/mega65/verify-rom.png)

### Xemu

1. Rename `MEGA65.BIN` to `MEGA65.ROM`.
2. Load the *xmega65* Xemu application.
3. Right-click anywhere on the *xmega65* window and menu items will appear as shown in the image below:

4. Select *
