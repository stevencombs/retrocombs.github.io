My Master the MEGA65 Keyboard created a lot of informative conversation. I knew during the creation of that content that I was going to miss, or mis-explain, concepts and prepared for the comments and suggestions to roll in. The MEGA65 community didn't let me down and in this blog post and companion video, I've captured the best additions to further our knowledge of the MEGA65 and continue to build a mastery of the keyboard.

I want to thank everyone who contributed to this addendum and I've done my best to give proper attribution and with a first name. If you'd like your entire name listed or if I missed a recommendation, please drop me an [email](mailto:retrocombs@icloud.com) and I'll correct on this blog post.

## Additional Keyboard Mastery Skills

### Boot to a Specific ROM

I showed how to boot to a specific core, but Anton shared that you can boot to a specific ROM and you have 10 available, "slots." The key to this trick is to name the ROMs with the format `MEGA65#.ROM` with `#` a value from 1 to 0.

<!-- Test with a ROM without a # -->

Here's an example:

1. Load the most current ROM and name it `MEGA65.ROM`
2. Load the first C65 ROM (911001) and name it `MEGA651.ROM`
3. Load the second C65 ROM (911210) and name it `MEGA652.ROM`
4. Load the OpenROM and name it `MEGA653.ROM`
4. Hold the 1, 2, or 3 key while you power up the MEGA65 to boot the different ROM.

> **NOTE:** Remember that the original C65 ROMs are owned by Cloanto. If you own a DevKit or a MEGA65 you do have rights to the ROM; however, if you don't, you can purchase them inexpensively ($10 USD) as part of [Cloanto's C64 Forever](https://www.c64forever.com/). 

This is handy if you want to run the original C65 ROM versions or test various MEGA65 ROMs like the Open ROM.

### SHIFT + ENTER

Deft: shift+enter : next line without executing. handy if you type greetings etc

### HELP

Paul: The HELP key does serve a purpose and that is, to identify a line of code with a syntax error. When a BASIC program syntax error occurs, press the HELP key and the MEGA65 will list the line that caused the error.

<!-- load the submarine tracking program, break a line about mid way and then use HELP -->

### CAPS LOCK

Deft: The super power of the CAPS LOCK work in C64 mode. Holding the CAPS LOCK key will set C64 mode to 40 Mhz. This is useful when listing long BASIC programs or loading software from legacy devices.

### MEGA65 Color Palette BASIC Program

Since this video, I did release my MEGA65 Color Palette program [version 1.5 on the FileHost](https://files.mega65.org?id=1813f548-7280-4b73-9112-abc24b90892b). This new version includes the updates below:

1. Title decorations
2. Column headings
3. Color HEX codes (thanks Tayger!)
