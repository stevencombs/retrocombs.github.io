Introduction to Part 2 of 4


Welcome back to part two of my four part FAST LOAD series on four portable retro-handheld gaming consoles, all under $60, that I purchased during Amazon Prime Day 2021. In the last episode, I looked at the Great Boy with 380 games and compared it to our baseline device, the RetroFlag GPi Case. In this episode I take a look at the LiNKFOR handheld with 500 games. Like the last video, I'll open the box, tear it down, highlight features, and then share demos of worthy retro-games titles. Let's dig inâ€¦

That concludes part two and this look at the LiNKFOR retro handheld gaming console. Be sure to check out the companion blog post for much more information.
