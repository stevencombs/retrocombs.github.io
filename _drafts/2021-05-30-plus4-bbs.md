I've recently spent much time with the Commodore Plus/4, a Commodore computer I didn't own in the 1980s, and while I've worked my way through chapters one through eight, there are more things I want to do with this capable 8-bit, and unloved, Commodore computer.


<!-- Video Notes

1. Try it in a Terminal on a modern computer (example)
3. Record search for BBS that leaders to `particlesbbs`
4. Sponsorship, Commodore4Ever, thank you!
5. PiZero 1541, also from Commodore4Ever, I'm still working on my 3D printed case.
6. CCGMS 2021 used to demonstrate configuration, but not available for Plus 4; only a series of rudimentary telecom software that lacks the bells and whistles like Commodore Graphics characters, colors, and PETSCII.
7. I tried everyone available at Plus world. If you know of one not shown, listed below, please let me know and I'll give it a spin.
8. If you want to try other software besides the packages I was able to get working, below are the key settings. 
9. Need a video that shows the configuration from start, but you might have that already.
10. List buy me a coffee supporters.

## Introduction

1. VIDEO RJ45 into Commodore Modem (take it out of the box)
2. Costly to call a BBS long distance in the 1980s
3. Show connection using telnet on Mac using `telnet particlesbbs.dyndns.org 6400` or using [their web interface](http://www.particles.org/particlesbbs/telnet-now/)
4. There was Quantum Link (who later became AOL "you've got mail.") but that was a pricey proposition because there was no local access number in my area until after the AOL transition.
5. Our local college hosted a computer-agnostic bulletin board and that provided  occasional fun.
6. Even though rarely used, I have fond memories of using my C128 and VIP Terminal XL to connect to the college and occasionally a long distance BBS. VIP Terminal XL was not the most popular, but I enjoyed the fun and colorful interface.

7. I didn't get a chance to experience the full breadth of BBS scene in the day or even access WOPR (insert video).
8. The BBS scene didn't die. There are BBS operators who have kept their BBS in operation since the 1980s using original hardware and then others who have deployed a BBS on more modern hardware; however, for me, a modems no longer works since I no longer have a phone line in my home. Thankfully you can access the majority of BBSs using an Internet application protocol, developed in 1969, know as [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet).

## The Wi-Fi Modem

Before working on this video, I had no experience with a modern Wi-Fi modem. I didn't even know they existed until early 2019. What is a Wi-Fi modem? Let's take a look.

## Test BBS Selection

Before I try to connect the Wi-Fi modem with Commodore Plus/4 to a BBS, I need to identify a test BBS and connect using Telnet. There are not a plethora of Plus/4 and C16 specific BBSs. I finally landed on the [Telnet BBS Guide](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com) and searched for "Plus/4". [PARTICLES! BBS](http://www.particles.org/particlesbbs/) at [particlesbbs.dyndns.org:6400](particlesbbs.dyndns.org:6400) was the only result. In operation since 1992 and now using a Commodore 128, I chose this BBS for my experiment. There are many other Commodore specific BBS options and you can view the results of a Commodore search [here](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/?s=Commodore).

> If you want to connect to this BBS in your browser and see all it has to offer, click [here](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/particles-bbs/). Want to go "old school?" Use an old school modem/phone line combo and dial 1-479-553-8122. I you don't have a modem or classic computer and want to visit this bbs, you can visit using Telnet with the command `telnet particlesbbs.dyndns.org 6499`.

## Terminal software

With an identified BBS, it was time to select Plus/4 software. Selecting Commodore Plus/4 telecommunication software was the hardest and longest part of this journey. There isn't a modern equivalent to the popular and up to date Commodore 64 software[CCGMS 2021](https://1200baud.wordpress.com/2020/12/24/ccgms-2021-released/). The Plus/4 hasn't received the same telecommunication software love. All software was abandonware from 1980s and 90s and my search took me to the [Utilities\|Modem area](http://plus4world.powweb.com/sl/315) of the [Plus/4 World website](http://www.plus4world.com) that lists the software below:

+4 Xmodem
ASCII-Transfer
Atari Terminal Emulator
BBS Term+ V1.2	
BBS Term+ V1.2 Quickv 1
Digicom-16	
HiggyTerm
Microterm 264
Mini-term V1	
Modem RS232 V1.2
Plus4 Online	
RS232 File Receiver
RS232 VT100 Terminal
Teleterm V4.0
Term-80
Terminal
Terminalsoft
Videotex Terminal
Work Bench	
Xmoterm Plus4 V2.0

Because telecommunications software was not as prolific as games and business software, there is little to no information online for these titles. Adding to the complication was several titles have a German interface. Not a huge issue for me, or you if you have [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) handy, but it does complicate configuration of the software to match the requirements of the Wi-Fi modem.

I tried EVERY one of these titles. Many "flat-out" will not work because they were locked at a baud rate of 2400 bps or lower and I didn't want the original 300 baud experience but the more modern 9600+ bps. After many hours of trial and error, I was able to identify six contenders: +4 Modem, HiggyTerm (available for the Plus/4 and C64), Terminal, Term-80, Video Tex, and Work Bench. Let's see how each one fares:

### +4 Modem



### HiggyTerm



### Terminal



### Term-80



### Video Tex



### Work Bench



## The Winners

From that list, I was only able to configure +4 Xmodem, Higgyterm, Terminal, Term-80, Video-Tex, and Workbench - with varying degrees of success. Let's take a look at each one and then select the one that should be our goto telecommunications platform on the Commodore Plus/4. Before I begin, the only software that remotely supported color was Terminal. None support Commodore graphics. Browsing a BBS on the Plus/4 is a pure text experience. Basic, but gets the job done. Higgyterm is the only software to support baud rates up to 19200 (which the Wi-Fi modem supports).

In the next section I demonstrate how to get the Wi-Fi modem working on the Plus/4 with these software titles using a combination of instructions from Commodore4Ever and a whole lot of trial and error.

## Setup Instructions

Below are the steps I used to configure the Wi-Fi modem using the 

1. Plug the modem into your Commodore user port with the chip side up and then power up your Commodore. If you do not see a solid blue light on the modem then it is not getting any power and you will need to trouble shoot your Commodore. I suggest cleaning the contacts of the user port first.
2. If using a commodore 64 or 128 is 64 mode, Load CCGMS 2017. If you are using a 128 in 128 mode Load a term program of your choosing and follow the program setup instructions. (I am assuming you know how to load a program from media such as a floppy disk or SD Card)
3. Press F7
4. Select modem type as User Port, and select 300 baud. You must do it in this order. If you select the baud rate first and then the modem type second the baud will change when the modem type is selected!
5. Press Return to go back to terminal
6. Press Return Again and you should see the Modem Info on the screen
7. Hit F8 to go to Ascii mode
8. Enter your ssid and password with the following terminal commands: `at$ssid=ssid` and `at$pass=password` (Your Password and SSID CAN NOT contain any special characters. For best results SSID and Password should only use lower case letters and numbers.)
9. F8 to go back to the Graphics terminal
10. Type `atc1` to connect. You may have to do this a few times to get it to connect
11. Type the commands `at&p0` then `at&k1`. Without doing this 9600 baud will lock up your Commodore.
12. Change the baud rate by typing `at$sb=9600`
13. Press `F7` Menu and select modem type as Up9600 Baud  and then 9600 Baud
14. Save your settings
15. Press `‚èé` to go back to terminal. At this point if your terminal will not respond to any type of input, you will want to start all over. This time instead of changing the modem to up9600 and the baud to 9600, leave the modem type at userport and change the baud to 2400 and then continue. up9600 is a hack that tricks the userport into going 9600 baud and in my experience has issues on some machines, WHY? I could not tell you. Sometimes if you repeat the setup steps several times the modem will allow 9600 baud.
16. Type `at&w` to save the setting to the modem
17. Type in the address of your favorite BBS and you are back in the 80's!
