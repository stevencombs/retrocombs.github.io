Time to take a break from retro and look a new wearable, the [iTouch Air 3 Smart Watch](https://itouchwearables.com/). Regular readers/viewers know my normal place to purchase wearables and gadgets is [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3xXi6H7) and even though this new purchase is from ALDI, the iTouch Air 3 is available from a number of vendors such as Walmart, Kohls, and [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3jXyvpF) without the additional ALDI special find $10 discount from retail. Let's take a look at this new smart watch and compare it to my other recent purchase, the [Wyze Watch 47](https://www.stevencombs.com/wyze-watch).

## YouTube Video: Wyze Watch 47 versus the iTouch Air 3 Smart Watch

In the video below, I open the box and power up my ALDI iTouch Air 3 purchase. I then make comparisons with my Wyze Watch 47.

## The purchase

This was an impulse buy, as is the majority of ALDI finds. This experience is common for me. There are occasions when ALDI has gadgets and electronic items of interest. For my European followers, ALDI is a mainstay; however, they have a much shorter history over the pond and not a reputation for quality electronics. 

It is my understanding, tying my gadget content to my retro content, that ALDI sold their own [Commodore 64 variant](http://ode2commies.blogspot.com/2015/07/introducing-c64-aldi.html) in the late 1980s!

Oh, how I would like to get my hands on one of these since it combines two of my favorite brands!

I digress. While out of town on business, I stopped by the local ALDI to grab items for my hotel. For this evening, dinner was a nice hummus tray complete with veggies and much cheaper/healthier than any local dining. As I alway do, I took a quick run down the special buys and noticed electronics. Not expecting anything of interest, two things ended up in my cart with my hummus; the iTouch Air 3 and the _________. There goes saving money on dinner and recouping per diem funds!

Going back to my retro theme, I use the _________ to prop the monitor for my MEGA65 for cable management and love that I can plug the USB ports into a Mac mini close by. This was a good purchase. Will the iTouch be a good purchase? Let's dig in and find out.

While shopping, I was wearing my [Wyze Watch 47](https://amzn.to/3m3M9uf). Followers know I own a [TicWatch C2+](https://amzn.to/3xKJLLe). I wear the Wyze for sleeping, workouts and general wear and upgraded form the standard band to the [Solob 22 mm stainless steel mesh band](https://amzn.to/3yOZABV) (which is amazing for $9!). When it is time to suit up at work, I throw on the TicWatch. Because the TicWatch requires a charge daily and the Wyze Watch is a weekly charging affair, I find the Wyze Watch more convenient, even if limited in function.

The cost of the iTouch Air 3 at ALDI was $49.95. This is $15 more than I spent on the Wyze Watch, plus shipping; however, the cost was within my impulse purchase budget for the month. I threw it in the cart and expected to open it when I got back to my hotel room. That would not be the case. It sat in the box for another two weeks while I found time to document, in both writing and video, my first experiences with my newest wearable.

The iTouch box was replete with features that, while not as full featured as Wear OS, provided an upgrade to the Wyze Watch including:

* Longer battery life
* Control of music apps
* Perform actions on specific notifications

Missing on both watches but available on the TicWatch are:

* Respond to messages
* Voice input
* Watch keyboard
* Application support 
* Large database of custom watch faces

However, it's all in the execution. Time to take the watch out of the box.

## Open the box (unboxing)

As mentioned above, the exterior of the box highlights the watch's features. I mention a few above; however, below is the complete list:

* Item 1

## Watch design and hardware

The watch design is similar to the Apple and Wyze Watch rectangle design. I prefer a circle design like my TicWatch and am biased; but I am not a fan of this form factor. Add to this design that there is no button or crown, and the iTouch is confusing out of the box and in normal use as I describe below.

Another oddity is that the screen is much smaller than the face of the watch and in regular lighting, you can see where this screen starts and ends. This is not the case with an Apple or Wyze Watch. With those models, you cannot see the edges of the screen until it lights up.

I did like the default band on the iTouch. Made of silicon, it is comfortable and features an opening that allows the excess material to slip under the band creating a smooth appearance on the wrist and one that reduces the possibility of catching the band on something.

## Power up

Getting this watch to turn on was a frustration. Out of the box, it would not turn on. To ensure a good user experience, many electronic devices have enough charge to turn on with a recommendation to place the device on a charger. The iTouch was dead on arrival.

I saw another watch on the checkout counter during a subsequent visit. I suspect it was a return because the purchaser couldn't get to turn on immediately, or who went through this same experience‚Ä¶

As someone who values a good battery, I placed the watch on the charger before I tried to turn it on. I shook the watch and look for any way to activate before reading the instructions. After my feeble attempts, I read the instructions; "tap and hold the screen for 3 seconds." Nothing. I tried this at least five more times with the same result, black screen. A Google search told me that I should hold it three to five-seconds. Two more seconds would prove to not be the solution. Another suggestion was to charge the watch for five minutes. I left the watch for fifteen minutes, returned, tapped the watch for five second and low and behold‚Äì‚Äìcrickets (chirp, chirp).

I theorized that fifteen minutes might not be enough time. I waited an hour; no prize in my cracker jacks. Out of nowhere, I decide to unplug the device from the charger. The screen changed from the battery indicator to the main watch screen. Success! I am not confident that the iTouch I saw on the ALDI counter was a return. How many consumers would put up with this experience?

Despite this laborious process to turn on the device, it was time to see if it was worth the wait. **Spoiler Alert:** Maybe???

## Watch operation

This is a $50 watch. I did not expect a premium Apple Watch or Wear OS experience. My expectation was in line with the Wyze Watch, Wyze Band, or a low-end FitBit. Without getting ahead of myself, the experience is similar to the Wyze Watch.

The low-resolution screen is bright. Movement between screens is a simple swipe in a specific direction, again, much like the Wyze Watch. Screen changes reveal, they don't slide, except for a swipe from the top which reveals a features shade. A swipe in other directions reveals more menus with 1990s'esque icons. On this pages, there is more menu swiping. It is not intuitive until you spend an hour or two with it and even then, not so much.

## Final thoughts and recommendation

* User experience is not institutive or pleasurable
* No firmware update out of the box - this worries me about future updates
* UI is dated
* Notifications ("Other" can't be modified and constantly shows notifications when using Google Maps; draining the battery)
