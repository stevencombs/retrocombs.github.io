I’ve lost my MEGA65 obsession focus by the newest retro-fad on the YouTubes, the NABU Personal Computer. I've shared my [unboxing](https://youtube.com/live/NK2tEIEFpYo?feature=share), [first use](https://youtube.com/live/54Ij7_qIBmw?feature=share), and [a cable build](https://youtu.be/7YMMC7tcRdQ). My experience with the device has been interesting and in this post, I want to share ten things about the NABU that surprised this Commodore computer fan. Let's dig in.

Let's look at ten things about the NABU that surprised this Commodore enthusiast, starting with the NABU’s industrial design.
## 1. Industrial Design
The NABU form factor is substantial when compared with Commodore computers of the same period. Commodore's bread bin case looks toylike next to the rugged metal VCR-sized NABU case. You can tell designers of the NABU created the "set-top-box" computer to look at home in a rack with 1980s video tape recorders and hi-fi audio equipment.

<!-- Insert image form manual along with racks of A/V equipment from 1980s -->

## 2. The Keyboard
At first glance, the 66-key qwerty keyboard with Alps key switches look bulky, with a lengthy cord hanging off its backside. The NABU's keyboard layout is odd, even for a 1980s computer, and includes `YES`, `NO`, `GO`, `RWD` & `FFWD` Keys. These keys were likely included to make the computing experience more intuitive to new users.

<!-- read the user’s manual to verify -->

The keyboard feel is a surprise. In a word, the keyboard feels "outstanding." The Alps keys provide a nice thunk that reminds me of early Apple keyboards. It feels professional and is a keyboard I want to use–a statement rarely said about 1980s home computers. Finally, the keyboard includes ports for two joysticks and those ports are my next surprise.

## 3. Standard 9 pin DIN joystick connectors
I'll admit, when I heard the NABU was a cable company contraption, I assumed everything would be proprietary; including connectors. DJ Sures uses a NABU joystick (I need to find me one of these) in his videos and assumed, because of its unique flight stick appearance, that the connector on the other end was proprietary.

<!-- include an image of the NABU joystick -->

To my surprise, the back of the keyboard includes the two DB-9 connectors found on Atari and Commodore computers. My [Hyperkin Trooper](https://amzn.to/3l1CHXj) and [Competition Pro](https://ebay.us/omzmAF) joysticks work perfectly with the NABU. I've not tried the [Hyperkin Ranger Paddle Controller](https://amzn.to/3orPuEv), but nothing leads me to believe it won't work except for paddle support in the software.

## 4. The NABU Network is LIVE (KINDA)
The NABU network is critical to the operation of the NABU personal computer. Last year, when boxes of NABUs first appeared, the only reason anyone would want one was for their historic value. Unbox it, turn it on, and the only thing the NABU could do is display a logo followed by an *adapter failure* message. I passed on the first round of boxes since there was only a hope that "one-day" the community might reactivate the network and in record time, that happened! 
By the time the next round of NABU boxes were available, users only need connect a [USB RS422](https://amzn.to/3RCLpdk) adapter to a modern PC, wire up a cable, load some free software, and the NABU network lights up, via Internet connectivity, these previously dormant NABU personal computers.

Once the network is live, the surprises about the NABU continue as you view retro advertising load pages while the original NABU software streams to your device. The NABU software delivery system was much more advanced compared to its contemporaries. No longer did the user have to visit a computer store to purchase software. It was now, then.

While Commodore had its own computer network [Quantum Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link), which would in 1989 become America Online (AOL), there’s no way for us to relive the glory days of that online service. And that’s too bad. But, if you want to experience another network contemporary, that’s where the NABU comes in and when you fire up the NABU network, that's where the software surprises begin.

## 5. Original Software
In the 1980s, families loaded and ran software from the NABU network. There was a floppy disk controller, but these were rare among normal consumers. It appears NABU provided free software and users could opt to purchase additional titles. I assume when the original network ceased, so did "ownership" of those software titles and imagine families were none too happy in the loss of their software investment.

In 2023, users can experience the [small list of titles](https://museum.eecs.yorku.ca/exhibits/show/v_tour/item/49#:~:text=NABU%20Network%20applications,8K%20ROM%20models.) without cost. You'll quickly mow through the titles available and find that they are mediocre, even for their time. There are faithful recreations of games and productivity apps such as word-processors and, of course, the requisite BASIC programming language, but they aren't that great. That's where hardware features come into play. The NABU uses standard hardware found on contemporary computers that include a:

- ZILOG Z80A, 8-bit, 3.58MHz clock speed processor
- 64Kb of RAM
- 16Kb of Video RAM
- Texas Instruments TMS 9918A
- General Instrument AY-3-8910 programmable sound generator

Because these specifications are like Japanese MSX computers, a [home computer architecture ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer "Home computer") used by several vendors and created by [ASCII Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_Corporation "ASCII Corporation") in 1983, the NABU has additional capabilities and compatibility when you replace the NABU ROM with an MSX ROM. Games are more refined, responsive, and true to the original arcade counterparts. Thanks to Cloud CP/M, you can now switch out ROMs and try many games and software originally not designed to play on the NABU.

## 6. Cloud CP/M
The NABU did not come with an operating system (OS). The company sent software through the coaxial cable network. Software was free or fee. In 2023, and with no external storage available (yet), DJ Sures has figured out how to hack [Digital Research's CP/M OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) on the NABU. This version of CP/M called, [Cloud CP/M](https://nabu.ca/cloud-cpm) adds productivity and geek tools to the NABU. DJ has even hacked in an 80-column scrolling display. It's a blast to use with various drives (`A:`, `B:`, and `C:`) and user areas serving as software collections.

Check out drive `B:` and `User 1` for an assortment of MSX games ported to the NABU (Thanks GWSS for that collection!). Type `summary` on drive `A:` and `User 0` to see a list that's updated regularly. Running CP/M in the cloud ensures you always have the latest version and features of the OS. It's kinda slick!

CP/M was available for Commodore computers in the mid-1980s, and the Commodore 128 had its own version; however, the NABU version is more convenient and, based on what I've heard, more full featured. But pulling software from a server is not the only way to run applications on the NABU.

## 7. Remote and Local Software
Thanks to software by GWSS and DJ Sures, we can download titles from the network via the Internet from different "channels." But that’s not the only way. You can download `.nabu` files to run locally using software such as the Internet Adapter Software from <https://www.NABUnetwork.com>.

## 8. Software and Hardware Developers
Not content with the NABU's original capabilities, software and hardware developers are creating new projects to extend functionality using modern programming techniques and hardware components. Like other popular retro-computing platforms, the NABU eco-system is alive and well with several software and hardware projects.

### NABU Software

Here's a short list of interesting utility and games projects in development:

1. [nabud](https://github.com/thorpej/nabud) - Operate your own NABU server.
2. [NabuNetworkEmulator](https://github.com/GryBsh/NabuNetworkEmulator) - Emulator for the NABU network adapter.
3. [Game Man Yeah!](https://nabu.ca/software#:~:text=LIB%20on%20GitHub-,game%20man%20yeah!,-Game%20Man%20Yeah) - Home brew four-player space miner game.
4. [Brick Battle](https://nabu.ca/software#:~:text=NABU%20Channel%20List-,brick%20battle,-A%20two-player) - Home brew two-player Brick-Out clone with multiple balls.
5. [Cloud GUI](https://nabu.ca/software#:~:text=NABU%20Channel%20List-,Cloud%20GUI,A%3A%20User%20Area%201,-CPMCURS.COM) - Think GEOS for NABU, but not.

We will continue to see [new software](https://youtu.be/ONclrBNkLmg) for the NABU so subscribe to those YouTube channels and follow those blogs.

### Hardware
Here's a short list of interesting hardware projects in development:

1. [F18A](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/280138-f18a-mk2/) - Originally designed for the TI-994/A, this board … 
<!-- ADD Board Description -->
2. [nabu.cpm](https://github.com/randomvariations/nabu.cpm) - This project combines software and hardware to run CP/M locally from an SD card.
3. [SD Card Expansion Board](https://github.com/TheCodeman/Nabu_PC) - Boot your NABU into BASIC using an SD card.
4. ESP board

Like software, there’s sure to be more hardware projects in development.

## 9. NABU Emulator
It surprised me to learn that NABU emulation was available through the use of MAME software. Yes, that MAME, the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator we use to play our favorite retro console titles. And NABU setup is similar. Install the MAME software, feed it a NABU ROM, boot, and away we go!

Download a complete [NABU emulator package for Windows](https://gtamp.com/nabu/nabu-mame.zip) and then [read the instructions,](https://gtamp.com/nabu/readme.txt). I'm sure Mac and Linux versions are coming soon.

## 10. Low Cost to Entry
Cost is the most surprising entry on my list. The retro hobby is expensive and when boxes of NABU units surfaced, I expected the owner would want to make a buck or two on his find. That's not the case. You can [purchase a NABU on eBay](https://ebay.us/PaU0QZ) for $60 plus shipping. You'll spend around $100 for the unit and then you'll need another few bucks to build a cable with the components below:

* [Monoprice MIDI Cable](https://amzn.to/3l7xKi9)
* [DTech USB to RS422 RS485 Serial Port Converter Adapter Cable](https://amzn.to/3RCLpdk)

Or you can purchase a [prebuilt Arcade Shopper cable](https://www.arcadeshopper.com/wp/store/#!/NABU-DIN5-RJ45-cable-with-DB9-adapter-for-RS422-connection-to-Nabu/p/530710449/category=144933272)

All in, you won't spend more than $150! That's a lot of retro-computing goodness and fun. I'm calling this the best $150 you'll spend on a retro system this year. When you compare to a [THEC64](https://amzn.to/41YpBxE) or a [THEA500 Mini](https://amzn.to/3ygCbL4), this purchase is a steal! [Grab one now](https://ebay.us/PaU0QZ).
