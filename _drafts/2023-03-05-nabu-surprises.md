I've been distracted lately. Not by my MEGA65 obsession, but by the newest retro-fad on the YouTubes, the NABU Personal Computer. I've shared my [unboxing](https://youtube.com/live/NK2tEIEFpYo?feature=share), [first use](https://youtube.com/live/54Ij7_qIBmw?feature=share), and [cable build](https://youtu.be/7YMMC7tcRdQ). My experience with the device has been interesting and in this post, I want to share the ten things that surprised this Commodore computer fan about the NABU. Let's dig in.

## Ten Surprises
Let's take a look at ten things about the NABU that surprised this Commodore computer fan.

### 1. Industrial Design
The NABU form factor is substantial when you compare it with Commodore computers of the day. Commodore's bread bin cast looks childish as compared to the metal VCR -sized case of the NABU. You can tell designers of the NABU created a computer you can stack with your other 80s VCR equipment or stereo equipment.

Looks like it belongs next to a VCR or in a server rack

### 2. The Keyboard
Awesome Alps Keys with a LONG chord
YES/NO/GO/RWD&FFWD Keys
Port for two joysticks which leads me to number 3.

### 3. Standard 9 pin DIN joystick connectors
I'll admit, when I heard the NABU was a cable company contraption, my mind went immediately into proprietary mode. I had seen the NABU joystick DJ Sures was using in his videos and thought, there's a unique plug on the other end of that one. To my surprise, the back of the keyboard includes the two nine pin DINS we are all familiar with. My [Hyperkin Trooper](https://amzn.to/3l1CHXj) and Competition Pro joysticks work perfectly with the NABU. I've not tried the [Hyperkin Ranger Paddle Controller](https://amzn.to/3orPuEv), but nothing leads me to believe it won't work either.

### 4. The NABU Network is LIVE (sorta)
When connected via a USB RS422 adapter and using free software

You can even check out cool retro NABU ads that served as software and network loading screens.

We can't say that about the Commodore's online service, Quantum Link.

### 5. Original Software
The NABU had all the standard apps you needed.

While NABU original title games aren't that great, you can load an MSXROM and play pretty faithful versions of popular arcade and home games.

Standard apps were fine, but there's a whole host of other apps available.

### 6. Cloud CP/M
The NABU did not come with an operating system (OS). Instead, titles were pushed over the coaxial cable network on demand. Software was either free or for purchase. In 2023, and with no external storage available (yet), DJ Sures has figured out how to hack Digital Research's CP/M OS on the NABU. This version of CP/M called, Cloud CP/M adds productivity and geekery tools to the NABU. DJ has even hacked in 80 column scrolling mode. It's a blast to use with various drives (`A:`, `B:`, and `C:`) and user areas serving as collections.

Check out the `B:` drive and `User 1` for a great assortment of MSX games ported to the NABU (Thanks GWSS for that collection!). Type `summary` on the `A:` drive and `User 0` to see a complete list that's updated regularly.

Running CP/M in the cloud ensures you always have the latest version and features of the OS. It's kinda slick!

CP/M was available for Commodore computers in the mid-1980s and was even included on the Commodore 128 but the NABU version is more convenient and, based on what I've heard, more full featured.

Pulling data from a server is not the only way to run applications on the NABU.

### 7. Remote and Local Software
Thanks to software by GWSS and DJ Sures, we can download titles on demand from various "channels"; however, we aren't limited to this function. You can download `.nabu` files and run them locally using their software. This will create another important NABU community.

### 8. Software Developers
Not content with the NABU's original capabilities, ‚Ä¶

Not content to push NABU software, there are other developers pushing NABU limits.

### 9. Hardware Developers
Like their siblings, there's new hardware coming to the NABU that will let us use it like a more traditional computer

### 10. Cost
This last one is the most surprising. The retro hobby is expensive and when boxes and boxes of NABU units were unsurfaced, I expected the owner to want to make a buck or two on his find. That's not the case. You can [purchase a NABU on eBay](https://ebay.us/PaU0QZ) for $60 plus shipping. You'll spend around $100 for the unit and then you'll need another few bucks to build a cable:

* [Monoprice MIDI Cable](https://amzn.to/3l7xKi9)
* [DTech USB to RS422 RS485 Serial Port Converter Adapter Cable](https://amzn.to/3RCLpdk)

Or you can purchase a [prebuilt Arcade Shopper cable](https://www.arcadeshopper.com/wp/store/#!/NABU-DIN5-RJ45-cable-with-DB9-adapter-for-RS422-connection-to-Nabu/p/530710449/category=144933272)

All in, you won't spend more than $150! That's a whole lot of retro-computing goodness and fun. I'm calling this the best $150 you'll spend on a retro system this year. When you compare to a [THEC64](https://amzn.to/41YpBxE) or a [THEA500 Mini](https://amzn.to/3ygCbL4), this purchase is a steal! [Grab one now](https://ebay.us/PaU0QZ) before they are gone!
