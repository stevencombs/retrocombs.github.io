Full disclosure, I use my [M1 MacBook Pro][1] daily, e.g. this blog post, and wouldn't think about replacing it with any other computer (including the new MacBook Pro). It is the best computer I've ever owned. It's fast, has great battery life, and plows through any task I throw at it. With that confession, this blog post is a fun exercise to keep the nostalgic rivalry between Commodore and Apple alive.

I am not going to ditch my MacBook Pro and start using my [MEGA65 Dev Kit][2] full time; however, there are features of the MEGA65 that are better than a modern MacBook Pro. Many of these features are inherent in the system the MEGA65 is based on, the never released Commodore 65, and other features come from the MEGA65 development team's updates. And yes, before I continue, I can create another list where the MacBook Pro excels over the MEGA65, but what's the fun in that comparison?

Before I begin, a quick MEGA65 release update. Several have commented on past videos asking what happened to the Christmas release of the MEGA65 and questioning availability. First, the MEGA65 is now on track for a Spring/Easter release. In the [MEGA65 teams own words][3] from 2021-12-09:

> HO HO OH NO! SANTA IS IN QUARANTINE! But we make sure the easter bunny gets his booster vaccination. Due to the current situation it is impossible for us to send out any MEGA65s in December. We are holding our breath for March. Please bear with us!

> tl;dr version: We have been fighting shortage of electronic components for months and mostly succeeded.  But now, last minute, seemingly trivial things like cardboard for your lovely printed boxes are unavailable! We most probably cannot ship before March 2022 and are truly sorry for this. The good news: We will then be able to ship larger quantities at once which means you might face close to or no delay at all. We will keep you updated and continue doing what we all, you - the community and the MEGA65 team, believe in.

There are positives to the delay. The initial shipment will be larger quantities, which means, [if you order now][4], you might be one of the first to have the Easter Bunny drop a shiny new, egg colored, MEGA65 on your door step!

Before you read my ten reasons, take a look at my companion video below.

## 10 ways the MEGA65 is better than a my M1 MacBook Pro

Let's begin our list of the 10 ways the MEGA65 is better than my M1 MacBook Pro.

### 1. Boot Time

Commodore computers, like all late 1970's and early 1980's 8 bit computers, have fast boot times. I can't think of any 8 bit computer that doesn't beat a modern Mac to startup. Despite the M1 MacBook Pro booting faster than any other Mac I've owned, it can't compare to the MEGA65. Flip the switch and __ seconds later, it's ready to go. The MEGA65 boots almost as fast as the time it takes to hold down the power button on my MacBook Pro to begin the boot process. Once the MEGA65 is booted you are ready to go but on the MacBook Pro you first login and then wait longer as the remainder of the OS loads. Granted, the MacBook Pro is no slouch when it comes to boot up, but it can't top the MEGA.

What about reboots? No competition. Toggle the MEGA65 power switch is faster than using your mouse to find the *Restart* option in the Mac OS menu bar.

If you want to restart/reset the Mac, there's a menu item available. Much like reboot, but without the power cycle, the Mac will shutdown and instantly reboot. The MEGA includes a reset button. Tap it, and even faster than a power cycle, the MEGA65 is ready to go.

The MEGA65 continues the tradition of Commodore fast boot and even beats wonderful modern systems such as [THE64][6] and my [Combian pi/400][7]. And the MEGA65 even includes fast system updates.

### 2. Fast Updates

The MEGA65 receives updates to both the FPGA core and the closed ROM on a regular basis. Prior to 2022, "flashing the core" was a slow and laborious process; [however, a recent update](https://www.stevencombs.com/mega65-core-testing-livestream) increased core flash update speeds by 1809%! That is not a typo! You can check watch the comparison in the video below:

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XobWGbFfVxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></p></div>

When the MacBook Pro receives an OS update, it means a multi-Gigabyte download, followed by a series of restarts. Even with the speed of the M1 processor, the update can take 10 minutes or more. Prior to the new MEGA65 core flash utility, the time would have been similar; however, the MEGA65 now blows the MacBook Pro away. Even when I add the time it takes to download and transfer the core to the SD card, the MEGA65 process is faster. This time will continue to decrease once/if the MEGA65 includes the ability to download the core directly using the built-in Ethernet port.

During the updates, we use the MEGA65 keyboard and there's something special about this keyboard.

### 3. Keyboard

Apple has had a hard time with keyboards on MacBooks the past couple of years, but they finally got back to their roots and the MacBook now includes a fine keyboard; however, the MEGA65 includes a wonderful mechanical keyboard that is a pleasure to use. To [quote the Museum of Electronic Games and Art (M-E-G-A)][8]:

> Our friends at [GMK][9] have done an incredible job producing these uncompromising mechanical keyboards. Metal frames, cherry MX switches, four RGB LEDs, CPLD based bus system and other details make the best keyboards we can imagine.

Typing on the MEGA65 is a joy and while Commodore computers had better keyboards than many 8 bit systems of their time, e.g. [Atari 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family#400/800_release) and [Timex Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair), there was room for improvement. The MEGA65 adds the best keyboard every to grace an 8 bit Commodore computer and includes Cherry MX switches attached to a steel frame. Typing is comfortable, responsive, and clicky!

The layout of the MEGA65 keyboard is an upgrade to the Commodore 128 keyboard; sans the numeric keyboard. That space has been replaced by the internal 3.5" floppy drive. The MEGA65 keyboard follows the design and layout of the [Commodore C65][10] closely but with an upgrade; both the CAPS and SHIFT Lock keys include an LED indicator not found on the prototype for the C65.

The MEGA65 includes two LEDs at the top of the keyboard, one on the left and one on the right. Both are programmable from assembly or BASIC, via a `POKE` command. Imagine games that make use of these LEDs for application alerts or game accomplishments. Since Apple decided to kill their Touch-bar (which I love), these LEDs now allow the MEGA65 to provided visual feedback that the Mac now lacks.

Because the MEGA65 team stuck to the original keyboard layout, your modern keyboard muscle memory will confuse you when typing symbols like `"`, `@`, `(`,`)`, and `=`, to name a few. With the inclusion of function and modifier keys, there are a lot of keystrokes to learn on the MEGA65 that are not going to transfer back to a MacBook Pro. But that is a good thing.

We want the original Commodore keyboard experience for BASIC programming and immediate mode.

### 4. Immediate Mode, BASIC Programming and Text

The MEGA65 boots to a blue screen called the *Screen Editor* and is immediately ready to go. At the top left of the screen is a color rainbow and in the center is copyright information that includes the ROM version, date, and time. A blinking cursor awaits and without loading software, there are three things you can begin doing in this empty blue space:

1. Immediate Mode - Test BASIC programming lines of code or make calculations.

2. BASIC Programming - Use the enhanced MEGA65 BASIC programming to create your own programs. The MEGA65 uses Commodore BASIC 10 and includes new features provided by the MEGA65 team. It's the best BASIC of any Commodore computer and software running in BASIC at 40Mhz, with the command `FAST`, brings new zip to programs. MEGA65 BASIC includes enhanced editing features such as page scrolling and search and replace via the `CHANGE` command.

3. Text Mode - This one is a cheat because it does require the use of the `EDIT ON` command. When you do, the text on screen is no longer parsed by the BASIC interpretur and the `READY` prompt changes to `OK`. Text after each line number, required, is flat text. Automate numbering using the `AUTO 10` (or other number) command. Save the text to disk as a `.SEQ` file using the `DSAVE` command. To recall the file, use the `DLOAD` command. If you want view the text file, use the `TYPE` command. You now have a text editor at your disposal. Use `EDIT OFF` to return to BASIC mode.

In order to do these things on my MacBook Pro, I have to load either a calculator, emulator (since BASIC is no longer available on an Apple computer, and that's a shame), or a text editor.

Once an application loads, who knows if I will be able to get any work done once the MacBook Pro distraction begins.

### 5. Distraction Free

When you use a MEGA65, you receive no notifications. It's just you and the MEGA65. There's no notification system to distract you from BASIC programming. That's a nice change of pace from modern computing devices that want to disrupt your life. Applications don't have the ability to lurk in memory and bug you when you are focused on another task.

You mean there are applications available for the MEGA65? Yep, and in boxes!

### 6. Boxed Software

At the time of this writing, the first boxed software, [Hibernated 1 - Director's Cut - MEGA65][11] from developer Stefan Vogt/Puddle and publisher [poly.play][12] was released for 35€/$37. The publisher describes it as:

> Hibernated 1 - This Place is Death (Director's Cut) is an Infocom style interactive fiction game. It's a complete rewrite of the classic, award-winning Hibernated game using Infocom's Z-machine standard, with tons of additional narrative content and riddles. If Infocom had been asked to recreate the classic Hibernated, the Director's Cut would have been the outcome.

The shrink-wrapped box includes:

- Director's Cut features:
- 3.5" floppy disk
- Cardboard box with slipcase (23 x 18.5 x 2.5 cm)
- Mission patch
- Developer's autograph card
- MicroSD card including disk images and more
- Manual (DIN A5, English)
- Quick guide "How to Play Interactive Fiction"
- Stickers
- Poster (Din A3)

These features add to the nostalgic feel of purchasing software in the 1980s. I can't wait to open my box and dive in. Stay tuned for a full review and let's hope this is the first of many boxed software releases for the MEGA65.

> **BONUS:** A downloadable, and name your own price, version of [Hibernated 1 - Director's Cut - MEGA65][13] is available to use in emulation or on any other retro computer.

I don't remember the last time I purchased physical software for my Mac. It's all App Store this and App Store that. While the convenience is nice, for games, I miss those little extras like printed maps, patches, and stickers.

The software runs from a 3.5" floppy disk but, if you can't wait for your MEGA65 to arrive, the SD card includes a .D81 image you can use with the [Xemu Xmega65 emulator][14]. [Start your adventure now][15]!

### 7. OS Flexibility

The MEGA65 uses the FPGA for onboard memory and includes an SD card and a microSD card for auxiliary storage. An internal SD card serves as the default SD card. Inserting a microSD into the external slot will override the default to allow for multiple ROM experimentation.

The MEGA65 includes 7 slots for cores. Using the technique above allows testing of ROMs, cores allow a complete rewrite of the base hardware. Cores are now available for the MEGA65, Gameboy, and ZX Spectrum with Commodore computer cores to come. Stay tuned for more collaboration with the miSTer community to bring more cores to the MEGA65. I'd recommend sticking to Commodore cores since the keyboard is better suited for these computers but the MEGA65 allows you to make that decision.

> For a list of cores available or in progress, see [What are “alternative” MEGA65 cores? | m65cores](https://sy2002.github.io/m65cores/)

Try downgrading or using alternate OSs on your Mac. It's not a great experience. The M1 chip does allow emulation, but the experience requires emulation software and complete OS installs.

The MEGA65 core and SD card solution is a much better user experience if you are looking for an authentic experience and because of the FPGA, each core can address the numerous ports on the MEGA65.

### 8. Ports

My MacBook Pro includes two USB-C ports. If I need additional connections, I plug in a dongle. Out of the box, the MEGA65 includes:

- two 9-pin DIN connectors for joystick our mouse
- cartridge slot for C64 cartridges
- IEC connector for 1541/71/81 drives or printers
- RGB connector for VGA monitor
- Ethernet port for network connectivity
- headphone jack for headphone or powered speakers

Now my MacBook Pro does include a headphone jack, there's that, but all these connections make using the MEGA65 compatible with older Commodore devices and new creations like the [Pi1541][17] that simulates a 5¼ or 3½ inch floppy.

### 9. Built-in 3½ inch Floppy Disk Drive

While the MEGA65 supports .D81 disk images (and soon other disk image formats like .D64), you don't have to emulate a floppy disk drive because the MEGA65 includes one. This is something an Apple computer will never have again. There's no room for it!

The internal 3½ inch drive goes a long way when you use a MEGA65. Programs are tiny compared to their modern siblings and MEGA65 developer Paul is committed to pushing the limits of what is possible with a 3.5" floppy disk on the MEGA65.

He's [stretched capacity][18] for the original 1581 drive from 800Kb to 2+ Mb! I don't see anyone from Apple messing with firmware and the "[kernal][19]" on my MacBook Pro to push file storage on my internal 512 Gb to 1Gb!

But there's another reason the 3½ inch floppy is a nice addition and it's the nostalgia factor.

### 10. Nostalgia

I hinted earlier that BASIC was no longer available on Apple devices by default and new Macs have no connection to their older 8-bit parents. The Apple II/Commodore 64 battle was won by Commodore. They outsold Apple and the Commodore 64 became the best selling computer of all time; however, in the end, Apple survived and while you can say modern Macs have the legacy of the first Mac, there is no legacy system for the Apple II line.

The MEGA65 picks up the Commodore legacy and brings it forward to the twenty-first century in a way that is both retro and modern. TheC64 came close, but the MEGA65 is a true successor and when they ship, you will open the box, plug in the cables, flip the switch, and say, "Commodore is back, baby!"

## Conclusion

As I stated earlier, this post and companion video was a fun exercise to help you learn more about the MEGA65. I can create several LONG lists where the Mac excels over the MEGA65 but that should be an expectation. The fact that the MEGA65 has advantages is both an indication that we've not come too far with computer technology to not recognize computing history's past. If nothing else, I hope this blog post and video ramp up excitement around the Spring release of the MEGA65. Even though I have a Dev Kit, I'm excited to see the final product arrive, in a box, with a manual, on my doorstep.
