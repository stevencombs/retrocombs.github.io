## Windows??? Nooooooo!

I hate to admit it, but Windows is the best platform to use for my on-the-go MEGA65 development device. It pains me to say this because I'm an Apple guy; however, there are several reason that include:

* better keyboard compatibility with PC keyboard
* larger selection of Commodore emulator and development software such as  DirMaster and {Insert DEV IDE}
* I can modify an inexpensive laptop keyboard and not muck up my Mac
* I can pick up a decent Windows laptop for around $300 (more on this later)
