## Ten Things

THEC64 and THEVIC20 devices are wonderful Commodore computer revivals but what if you want a more original Commodore computing experience with a touch of modern? The MEGA65 will be your goto device and I'm going to share with you 10 reasons why.

### 1. Use C64 Cartridges (are C65 carts on their way?)  - Some neighbors borrow tools

Unlike THEC64 series, you can't use original Commodore 64 Cartridges or any of the cool homebrew or new games. In order to use cartridges you need to break out an original C64 and these are getting harder and harder to find and keep operational.

### 2. Use IEC devices  (1581s, pi1541, etc) and real Floppy Disks

TheAnd, yes. You can still order 3 1/2 inch floppy disks in both DS/DD and DS/HD. Which do you need? ...

### 3. Run a C65 specific version of GEOS



### 4. Play C65 enhanced games

Here are few games in-development or complete:

1. Luma - Puzzle game
2. The Job - An 80s inspired text adventure

### 5. Learn to program in BASIC 10 and become a developer

The joy of owning a computer in the 1980s was learning BASIC. You had to if you wanted your computer to do anything. For me, it was a few months later before I could afford to purchase a Commodore Datasette for my Commodore VIC-20. Even then, it was not easy to find software since I lived an hour away from the closest metropolitan area. My option was to get a subscription to COMPUTE! and RUN magazines. Each month their arrival would include BASIC programs ready to type, save and use. While typing in programs, you learned about BASIC programming commands and logic.

Luckily, the MEGA65 comes with a huge upgrade to Commodore's original BASIC version 1.0 and includes an updated version 10 with commands from BASIC 3.5 found on the Commodore Plus/4 and version 7 found on the Commodore 128. Be sure to check out my [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual series](https://www.stevencombs.com/plus4) to see the new BASIC commands not included with the VIC-20 or C64.

BASIC is great; however, in development is a wonderful MEGA65 mode development environment called Eleven. With Eleven you can develop games and software using an enhanced BASIC structure (no line numbers) and then compile the software. Add  Eleven to the power of the MEGA65 and you have a powerful and convenient on device development environment. I can't wait to dive into Eleven for my next BASIC programming project.

### 6. Use retro joysticks

When you play a retro-game, you should use a retro-joystick complete with 9-pin connector, a single joystick, and a lone fire button; not a joypad or pad with fifty or so buttons.

### 7. Use a wireless USB mouse (see my previous video) - or any other modern USB mouse.

Unfortunately, input devices from the 1980s were not built to last and finding devices that work can be a futile or expensive proposition. Luckily, there are many manufacturers of retro-style joystick; however, to my knowledge, no one makes a modern version of a Commodore 1351 mouse. Luckily we live in a world where microcontroller are a dime a dozen and tinkers create amazing things such as the mouSTer from [retrohax.net](https://retrohax.net). What's the mouSTer you ask? It's a device that allows users to use modern joysticks and mice on Atari and Commodore retro-computers. You can even use wireless devices as I demonstrate in [my full mouSTer video](https://youtu.be/OdPSfqBS5S8). Take a look at that video to get more information.

### 8. Connect to PC with M65 Connect

M65 Connect is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows with feature parity. M65 Connect provides tool to connect directly to the FPGA board to access the SD card, ‚Ä¶

### 9. Install additional cores (Mister)

The MEGA65 is built on top of a ????? [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array). The beauty of an FPGA is ability to configure the circuitry to act like other digital devices, such as our favorite retro-computers. While the MEGA65's primary design is to be a modern remake of the in development Commodore 65, it includes enough space, or slots, where you can install other "cores" to configure the FPGA to act at other devices. Current cores include the Gameboy and ZX Spectrum; however, we can look forward to Atari, Amiga, and other retro-computing cores for the MEGA65.

### 10.Connect to a BBS

This is recent development for the MEGA65 DevKit.

### Bonus, Use a REAL commodore style keyboard (with PETSCII and layout)

Throughout this video, you've seen me use the MEGA65 DevKit, which includes a wonderful mechanical keyboard. Mechanical keyboards are all popular and inexpensive today; however, in the 1980s, full mechanical switch keyboards came on expensive business computers. The original Commodore keyboards weren't bad though and one of the things that I appreciated was their inclusion of the PETSCII characters, colors, and functions printed right on the top, and FRONT, of the keys. This made using the keys a joy. The MEGA65 includes a spectacular mechanical keyboard complete with those original Commodore key character stamps. And not a single stamped, but double-stamped for clarity and durability. This thing is built for the long haul.
