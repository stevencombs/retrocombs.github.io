I have wonderful supporters for this blog and the companion [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/stevencombs). It may be a small group, but it is a mighty one that is growing. If you'd like to be a supporter and end up on this page (or in future videos), read below to learn how and the benefits.

1. [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/retrocombs).
2. Click the **♡ THANKS** button underneath one of my videos.
3. Click the **SUPER CHAT** option during a livestream.
4. Become a **MEMBER** (Coming Soon).

Either way you choose, will land you on this page in one or multiple categories; one-time, multiple, and/or member.

Your support, along with my use of Google Adsense and Amazon Affiliate links, will allow me to provide more gadget and retro-computing content.

## Current Benefits

- **One-time:** My sincere gratitude and thank you via email; buy me a coffee, or tweet.
- **Multiple:** $15 or more and you get a free retroCombs magnet shipped to you anywhere in the world!
