## Introduction

The TEDuino is a modern reimagining of Commodore TED (264) series Datasette using the Tapuino software, an Arduino, readily available electronic components, and my 3D printer (.stl) files.

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`⌫`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`⇧`  | Shift         |   ␣   | Space
