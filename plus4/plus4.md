## User's Manual

In the Commodore Plus/4 YouTube series, I work through each chapter of the Plus/4 user's manual. I've scanned each chapter and provide those below. I will post new chapters with each new video.

1. [Front Matter](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-title-introduction.pdf)
2. [Chapter 1 - Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-1.pdf)
3. [Chapter 2 - Using the Keyboard and the Screen](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-2.pdf)
4. [Chapter 3 - Using Software](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-3.pdf)
5. [Chapter 4 - Getting Started](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-4.pdf)
6. [Chapter 5 - Numbers and Calculations](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-5.pdf)
7. [Chapter 6 - Beginning BASIC Programming](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-6.pdf)
8. [Chapter 7 - Using Graphics and Color](/plus4/users-manual/p4um-chapter-7.pdf)

## Key to Keys

Because the Commodore Plus/4 keyboard is so different from modern keyboards, I had to devise and modernize key nomenclature to identify keystroke combinations as shown in the table below:

Key  | Description   | Key  | Description
:----|:--------------|:-----|:-----------
`⇪`  | Caps Lock     | `F1` | Function 1
`C=` | Commodore     | `F2` | Function 2
`⌃`  | Control       | `F3` | Function 3
`⎋`  | Escape        | `F4` | Function 4
`⌂`  | Home          | `F5` | Function 5
`⌫`  | Insert/Delete | `F6` | Function 6
`⏎`  | Return        | `F7` | Function 7
`RS` | Run/Stop      | `F8` | Help
`⇧`  | Shift         | `␣`␣  | Space

1. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual, Chapter 0 - Open the Box](/plus4-1)

    I share my first experience with a Commodore computer (it is not the Plus/4) and then open the box on my Commodore Plus/4 eBay purchase.

2. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual,- Chapter 1 -, Unpacking and Setting Up](/plus4-2)

    I open the Commodore Plus/4 manual for the first time and look at Chapter 1: Unpacking and Setting Up. Since the previous episode was an open the box, unpacking is already complete and this episode focuses on setting up the computer. Along the way I share a very cool tip.

3. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual,- Chapter 2 -, Using the Keyboard and the Screen](/plus4-3)

    I talk about the keyboard layout, using the keyboard, and then how keyboard combinations affect screen elements. This is really a "hands on" episode!

4. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual,- Chapter 3 -, Using Software](/plus4-4)

    I cover each auxiliary storage device in detail; however, I add a modern spin and instead of the original devices; I use a new [264 diagnostic cartridge](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/diag-264.html), a [Tapuino](https://www.stevencombs.com/tapuino-1), and a [Pi1541](https://www.stevencombs.com/pi1541-1).

5. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual,- Chapter 4 -, Getting Started](/plus4-5)

    It seems like we've been getting started over and over, but I guess now we really are since the manual told us so! In this chapter I look at keyboard colors, reverse printing, correcting mistakes, the screen, and even windows. Yes, that's right, I typed windows. See the blog post and video for more on that topic.

6. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual, Chapter 5 - Numbers and Calculations](/plus4-6)

    In this chapter, _Number and Calculation_, I learn how to use the Plus/4 as a calculator in immediate mode, create a function, and learn more about working with numbers in Commodore BASIC 3.5. I even combine some things we learned in previous chapters to amp up our programs. It is a packed chapter and even though I'm no math teacher; I hope I do the concepts justice. This is one chapter where I find the User's Manual a bit lacking but adequate.

7. [Commodore Plus/4 User's Manual, Chapter 6 - Beginning BASIC Programming](/plus4-7)

    In Chapter 6, _Beginning BASIC Programming_, of the Commodore Plus/4 user's manual, we begin where everyone should with their Commodore computer; learning the BASIC programming language. In previous chapters we have dabbled with BASIC; however, in this chapter, we dive in and learn the "basic" concepts you need to begin your BASIC programming journey.

8. [Chapter 7 - Using Graphics and Color](/plus4-8)

    Our first significant foray into custom graphics, besides PETSCII, on the Plus/4 begins in this chapter; _Using Graphics and Color_. The Plus/4 and its sibling, the C16 did not include sprites or other custom chips to enhance graphics; however, it did include a custom BASIC commands not found on the VIC-20 or C64. The extra graphics commands and additional graphics modes make the Plus/4 whole lotta fun if you want to draw on your computer using a command language.

## Companion Disk Image

As I progress through the user's manual, I enter and execute the sample programs. The link below is to a `.d81`.d64 image that below contains every program from each episode. **Currently, the image is not complete since we still have several chapters to go.**

[retroCombs User's Manual Disk Image](/plus4/plus4-users-manual.d81) - **UPDATED AS OF:** 2021-02-13

I use the following file name convention to make it easy to locate specific programs:

<img src="/images/design/floppy-disk-small.png" align="right">Sample Program Name: `02 RCOMBS SCROLLC1P2-5RETROCOMBS.PRG`

* `02C#` - where # is the chapter number
* `RCOMBS SCROLL` - my self assigned name for the BASIC program which will be immediately identifiable if you follow along.P#` - where # is the page number where the program is first referenced in the user's manual
* `NAME` - my self assigned name for the program

## Supplemental Posts

The posts below are helpful for any Commodore 8-bit computer enthusiasts but are also closely associated to this series and supplement the posts found above:

1. [retroCombs: Pi1541 Assembly and First Use](https://www.stevencombs.com/pi1541-1)

    In this supplemental episode to my Commodore Plus/4 series, I share my experiences assembling the Pi1541 Hat for a Raspberry Pi Zero. In the episode, I solder a pin connector onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, solder and assemble a serial cable with two 6 pin DIN connectors, assemble the whole package, and start up the Pi1541 for a first use.

2. [retroCombs: The Tapuino Project - Build an Arduino powered Commodore Datasette clone](https://www.stevencombs.com/tapuino-1)

    As part of my Commodore Plus/4 series, chapter three, of the user’s manual, includes a sections on using a Datasette and a disk drive. In a previous post, I built the modern replacement for the disk drive (a Pi1541), now it’s time to create a Datasette replacement called, the Tapuino.

3. [retroCombs: TEDuino: A Modern TED (264) Series Commodore Datasette](/_posts/2020/2020-10-06-teduino-1.md)

    In a previous post, I assembled the [modern replacement for the Datasette](https://www.stevencombs.com/tapuino-1), the Tapuino. For this project I use another Arduino, in this case the inexpensive Arduino Nano, some easy to source electronic components, and a 3D printer to create a Commodore 264 series inspired Datasette replacement I call, the TEDuino.

## Plus/4 Resources

Below are links I've found to be most beneficial as I work through this series:

1. [Commodore4Ever](https://commodore4ever.net/) - Source for Pi1451. Great customer service and feedback.
2. [The Future was 8-bit](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/) - Source for parts and used to provide resources for the Tapuino project. U.K. based so allow some time for delivery if in the U.S.
3. [RETRO Innovation](http://store.go4retro.com/) - Source for parts used for both the Tapuino and Pi1541 projects.
3. [Plus/4 World](http://www.plus4world.com/) - The most incredible source of Plus/4 information and software available. I don't know how the team does it, but if you have a Commodore C16, Plus/4, or 264, this is the site you must visit.
