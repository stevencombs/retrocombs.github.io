I dabble in code. I am not an expert and users of any code related project I share should do so at their own risk. My projects are sure not to be bug tested or optimized in any way. Did I mention I dabble in code?!? You have been warned.

Below are my code related project attempts. I also maintain a [GIST repository](https://gist.github.com/stevencombs/) of code snippets from various projects. These are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevencombs/).

## Hello World

Iâ€™m creating a [Hello World page](/hello-world/) that demonstrates a single program in multiple languages. You may find this valuable if you are new to coding and have an interest in the different programming languages and structure. *Please note that this page is under construction.*
